Context: Alex is a 35-year-old high school history teacher with a stable job and a loving partner. He's been using cannabis daily for the past five years, primarily in the form of edibles, to help manage stress from work. Recently, his partner noticed a change in his behavior and brought it up during an argument, leading Alex to consider the impact of his use for the first time. Alex is at the contemplation stage of change, recognizing that his use might be a problem but not yet committed to making a change. He has an appointment with a counselor specializing in substance use disorders to discuss his marijuana use.

Client: "I guess I'm here because my old man wanted me to check this out. He thinks I'm using too much, you know? But honestly, it helps me unwind after a long day of teaching.

Therapist: It sounds like you're grappling with a mix of feelings about your cannabis use and its impact on your life, particularly how it intersects with your role as a partner and a teacher. It's understandable that you turn to something that helps you unwind after the demands of your day. Many people find that their routines, including using cannabis, are deeply ingrained in their daily lives. You mentioned that your partner and your professional responsibilities have noticed changes, like forgetfulness or perhaps changes in your temperament, which is concerning to you as well. It's commendable that you're here exploring these concerns because it shows a level of self-awareness and commitment to the well-being of your family and your students. Can you tell me more about the times when you've felt that cannabis use was perhaps not aligning with what's most important to you, or when you've noticed it getting in the way of

**Context:** Lisa is a 34-year-old registered nurse who has been using cannabis for both medical and recreational purposes. She has been experiencing increasing anxiety and has been relying on marijuana to manage her symptoms. Initially, she was prescribed cannabis for chronic pain related to an injury sustained at work. However, her use has escalated over the past year, leading to increased absenteeism from work and concerns from her supervisors. She is in the action stage of change, acknowledging that her use has become a problem but struggling to make significant changes due to the perceived benefits for pain relief.

She's been brought to counseling by her pediatrician due to concerns about her young daughter witnessing her marijuana use.

**Context:** This session is a preliminary assessment at a community health clinic. The client, Dante, is a 24-year-old barista who has been referred by his primary care physician due to concerns about his recent increase in marijuana use, particularly concentrated forms like dabs, which he uses daily. Dante lives with his younger sister and works in a busy coffee shop. He has been experiencing interpersonal conflicts at home and work, and his physical health has started to decline.

Over the past year, Taylor has noticed that their daily cannabis use, primarily through vaping and edibles, has begun to interfere with their personal relationships and job performance. The initial assessment identified Taylor as being in the "contemplation" stage of change regarding their marijuana use.

**Client:** [During the session, Taylor seems contemplative, occasionally looking down at their hands fidgeting with a coffee stirrer.] "I guess I'm here because my partner mentioned that I might have a bit of a problem. I mean, I don't think I'm an addict or anything like that. I can quit anytime I want. But, you know, I do smoke or eat something every day. Maybe it's more than it should be... My friends and my partner say I'm different when I'm high. They say I'm more relaxed, but I don't know if that's a bad thing. On one hand, it helps me unwind after work, and on the other, I've missed a few shifts at the coffee shop because... well, let's just say my tolerance is pretty high now. It's like I need it to feel normal."

Therapist: It sounds like you're in a thoughtful space right now, considering your use and how it aligns with what matters to you, especially regarding your relationships and work. It can be challenging to hear that your use is affecting how those close to you see you, and it might feel different from the relaxation and unwinding it provides. You've noticed a change in your routine, with missed shifts at your coffee shop, which could indicate a shift in your daily habits. It's common for people to turn to something that helps them feel 'normal,' but it seems like you're also noticing the impact it has on other aspects of your life. You mentioned that you believe you can quit anytime you want, and that's an empowering stance to take. Have there been times when you've managed to go without marijuana for a while and how did that feel in relation to your current goals and values as a partner, parent, or professional?

Context: This session is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up at a community health clinic. The client, Taylor, is a 28-year-old software developer who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles on weekends due to stress from work and some recent relationship issues. During the initial assessment, Taylor was identified as being in the contemplation stage of change.

Client: Look, I know my weekend binges are a bit much sometimes, and my girlfriend's been giving me the business about it. She thinks I'm avoiding us, which might have some truth to it. But honestly, doc, I don't know if I can handle this job without something to take the edge off. It's not like I'm doing this every weekend, just when things get really intense at work. And I don't see edibles as a big deal compared to smoking or anything. I guess I can see how it might be a problem if I'm not careful, but can't everyone use something to unwind?

Therapist: Taylor, it sounds like you're caught between recognizing the impact your use has on your relationship and feeling like you need cannabis to cope with work stress. It's understandable that you're looking for ways to relax, especially after a challenging week. In moments of intensity at work, what strategies have you tried that don'

Therapist: It sounds like you're aware that your weekend use of edibles has been a point of concern for both you and your girlfriend, and you're recognizing that it might be a way to distance yourself from the relationship. You also value the stress relief that cannabis provides in the context of your demanding job. It's understandable that you're looking for ways to manage the intensity of your work environment. You mentioned that you don't see edibles as a 'big deal' compared to other forms of use, which is an interesting perspective. Can you tell me more about how you balance this perspective with the concern you've expressed about potentially being too avoidant? And how do you think your use aligns with the important role you have as a partner in your relationship?

The client, Elijah, is a 32-year-old construction worker who has been experiencing intermittent back pain due to his physically demanding job. He was prescribed medical cannabis for pain management but has also admitted to using it recreationally on weekends. During the initial assessment, Elijah scored moderate on the CRAFFT screening tool for substance abuse, indicating a potential for marijuana use disorder. Since the last session, Elijah has shown mixed progress; he reduced his use slightly but still reports daily consumption. He is in the action stage of change, actively trying to modify his cannabis use but struggling with consistent follow-through.

Therapist: Elijah, it sounds like you're really caught between the pain relief that cannabis provides and the concerns you have about its impact on your life, especially after hearing about your brother's accident. It's understandable that you're looking for some relief, given the demands of your job and the discomfort in your back. It's also clear that you care deeply about how your choices might affect not just your own health but also your relationships, like with your girlfriend and your brother. You've mentioned trying to cut back, which shows a real commitment to addressing this issue. Can you tell me more about what steps you've taken so far in this direction and what has helped you move towards those steps, even if it's been challenging at times?

**Context:** This session is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up at a community health clinic. The client, Taylor, is a 30-year-old barista living in a suburban area. She has been experiencing increased work stress and has turned to cannabis daily to help her cope. During the initial assessment, it was determined that Taylor's use may be leading to a marijuana use disorder, given its impact on her daily functioning and well-being. The clinician has noted that Taylor is in the "Contemplation" stage of change, acknowledging that there are problems with her use but not yet committed to change.

**Client:** [Taylor sits down, looking somewhat frazzled after a long shift at the coffee shop. She starts the session by expressing her concerns about her cannabis use.] "I guess I'm here because... well, my boyfriend says I use too much, but he doesn't get it, you know? I use in the mornings to get going, and then at night to unwind. It helps me cope with the customers and the chaos. But sometimes I feel like it's just there, waiting for me, and I can't start my day without it. He says I'm addicted, but I don't think it's that bad. I mean, I don't even get high most of the time

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying quite a bit on your shoulders with the demands of your job, and you've found that cannabis is a tool for coping with those challenges. You also mentioned that your boyfriend has expressed concern about how much you're using, and it seems like you're both coming from a place of care for you. It can be really tough to know when something we turn to for help becomes something that might be influencing our daily life in ways we hadn't planned. You've pointed out that sometimes you don't even get high, which suggests you're already noticing the presence of it in your routine. Can you tell me more about what you value in your life and how your use aligns or maybe conflicts with those values, especially as they relate to being a caring partner and a dedicated barista?

Context: This session is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up at a community health clinic. The client, Taylor, is a 32-year-old barista who has been experiencing increased anxiety and sleep disturbances. Taylor has been using cannabis primarily in the evenings to help manage stress. During the initial assessment, it was identified that Taylor's use could be problematic, with daily vaping of high-THC concentrates for both medical and recreational purposes. Since the last session, Taylor has shown some readiness to explore alternative coping mechanisms but still struggles with ambivalence about reducing cannabis use.

Client: "I mean, I know you're saying that my weed habit might be a bit much, and maybe it's not super healthy, you know? But like, every time I try to cut back, I just feel so on edge. It's like the anxiety just hits me tenfold. I was off it for a week, and honestly, I couldn't sleep at all. My mind was racing, and I was so wired. I guess I'm just scared of what might come up if I don't have that to chill out with. But on the other hand, my partner's been mentioning how I've been zoned out a lot lately, and I can't ignore that. It's like I'm there, but not really there

Therapist: It sounds like you've been noticing a significant impact on your well-being with your current use patterns, particularly in terms of how it affects your sleep and anxiety levels. It's understandable that trying to cut back has brought up some intense feelings—it's often the case that when we start to change our routines, especially those deeply ingrained ones, it can feel quite unsettling at first. You mentioned that your partner has noticed changes in your presence and engagement, which is an important aspect of your life. It seems like you value being fully present for your partner and perhaps for other important areas of your life as well. Reflecting on the goals you have for yourself and your relationship, how might these goals align with exploring different ways to manage stress and improve your sleep without relying on cannabis?

Carlos recognizes that his use has increased over the past year but is uncertain about how to change his habits. He is in the contemplation stage of change.

Therapist: "It sounds like you're aware that your use has been more frequent lately, and it's brought up some concerns for both you and your girlfriend. You mentioned that she thinks you might be addicted, and you've noticed a pattern where you find yourself reaching for cannabis, especially during moments of anxiety. It's insightful of you to recognize that this can create a cycle where the very thing intended to help can end up feeling like something you need to function. You also brought up an important point about the conflict between your desire to unwind and the possibility that this might be more than just something you can stop anytime. It's clear that you value your creativity and finding ways to de-stress after a long day at work.

**Context:** This session is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up at a community health clinic. The client, Marcus, is a 32-year-old construction worker who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of concentrates and edibles. He reports daily use, citing chronic pain from a work-related injury as one of his reasons for using marijuana. During the initial assessment, Marcus was identified as being in the "contemplation" stage of change.

**Client:** [During the session, Marcus leans back in the chair, looking slightly uncomfortable but engaged.] "I mean, I know my use has been a bit high these days. My buddy dropped that stat about how many folks in our neighborhood are dealing with pain management issues alone, and it made me think, you know? But here's the thing—this stuff really helps with my back, and sometimes, it's the only thing that does. I don't want to be dependent on it, but it's not like I can just stop. My pain doesn't give me a schedule."

**Therapist:** "It sounds like you're aware of the prevalence of pain management issues and how cannabis is playing a role in your life, especially with your injury. You're also recognizing the importance of the relief it provides. Can you tell me more about what concerns you might have

Therapist: I hear you saying that your marijuana use has been a significant part of managing your chronic pain, and it sounds like this issue is something that resonates with many in your community. It's understandable how difficult it can be to find relief, especially when it seems like there's no clear schedule to your pain. You mentioned that you don't want to become dependent on it, and that's a really important note. It's also clear that you're thinking about the broader context of your use, how it fits into your life and the company of others. Can you tell me more about what your ideal relationship with cannabis might look like? How does that vision align with what you've shared about your desires and concerns?

Context: This session is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up at a community health clinic. The client, Elijah, is a 32-year-old freelance software developer who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates for both recreational and self-medication purposes due to anxiety and insomnia. He acknowledges that his recent daily use has led to some negative consequences at work and in his personal relationships but expresses mixed feelings about changing his habits.

Client: "I guess I'm here because my girlfriend mentioned it, you know? She's been on my case about cutting back on this stuff. She says I'm 'high' all the time, even when I'm not literally. But honestly, I use it to chill out after dealing with code that feels like it's got more bugs than a Windows 95 desktop. It helps me unwind and sleep better.

Therapist: Elijah, it sounds like you're aware of the concerns both you and your girlfriend have noticed about your cannabis use, especially regarding how it affects your memory and your ability to meet deadlines at work. It's not uncommon for people to turn to something that helps them unwind after a long day dealing with complex code, and I can understand why cannabis has become a part of your routine. You've also mentioned the challenges you face when you wake up not remembering parts of the night before, which tells me this is something you're already reflecting on and recognizing as an issue.

You've clearly valued your relationship with your girlfriend enough to come in today, which shows a level of commitment to explore these concerns together. Can you tell me more about what aspects of your life are most important to you right now, and how cannabis use aligns or perhaps conflicts with those values?

**Context:** This session is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up at a community health clinic. The client, Taylor, is a 27-year-old barista living in a suburban area. She has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates for the past year and a half, mostly on weekends. Recently, her use has increased, and she's started to experience some negative consequences at work and in her relationships. Taylor acknowledges that her use might be a problem but is unsure about how to change her habits. She is in the contemplation stage of change.

Therapist: I can understand how it might feel challenging being in that position where you're managing different expectations and social environments, Taylor. It sounds like you're aware of the concerns your sister, and even your mom, have about your cannabis use, and you're noticing the impact it's having on your work life as well. You've identified some important values that seem to be at the heart of this, like maintaining a sense of integrity with your family and managing your responsibilities at work. It seems like there's a part of you that's already considering how you might navigate these social situations differently, acknowledging that you could indeed stop using on weekdays. Can you tell me more about what aspects of your life feel most important to you right now, and how they align with where you see yourself going with your cannabis use?

It sounds like this has been a concern for you, especially when it comes to missing deadlines and feeling the judgement from those close to you. You've also shared that you rely on cannabis for unwinding and getting to sleep, which tells me you value being able to relax and get the rest you need. It makes sense that considering changing this pattern feels a bit daunting.

🤝 It's really important for us to explore together what matters most to you, especially as a software developer and a parent, I imagine balancing clarity of mind with relaxation is something you've thought about before. Can you tell me more about your values as a professional and as a parent, and how they align or might be in conflict with your current cannabis use?

That's a really important observation, Maya, and it reflects a deep level of self-awareness and concern. You're also attuned to the broader conversation about cannabis potentially acting as an escape rather than a solution. It's clear that you value handling your stress in a way that aligns with your long-term well-being and goals. Can you tell me more about what those goals are and how your current use might be fitting into—or perhaps getting in the way of—achieving them?

She acknowledges that her use has escalated over the past few months but is hesitant to change her habits due to perceived benefits for her anxiety and concerns about social judgments.

Therapist: 👩‍⚕️ Theresa: Kaitlyn, it sounds like you're really tuning into some important observations about how your use is aligning—and perhaps not aligning—with the image you have of yourself and the life you want to lead. You mentioned noticing a decrease in your anxiety after vaping, and that's a significant aspect to consider. It's also powerful that you've recognized the shift in your relationship with cannabis, from something that enhanced experiences to something that perhaps feels more central to your daily life than you'd like.

You've brought up some really key points here. It's clear that you value being able to laugh and enjoy time with your friends without feeling like you need cannabis to do so. And it's also clear that you have concerns about managing your anxiety without it, as well as the potential impact on your relationships. These are all very important considerations.

Context: During a follow-up session at a community health clinic, the therapist is working with Isabella, a 28-year-old barista and part-time art student. She has been bringing her marijuana use to the forefront of her treatment after recognizing that her daily use, particularly in vaping form, has been impacting her motivation and creativity. Isabella identifies as being in the "contemplation" stage of change regarding her cannabis use.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really aware of the mixed experiences you have with cannabis use, how it can both support you and sometimes feel like it gets in the way of your goals. It's quite insightful of you to notice this seesaw effect, and I can see why finding balance would be important to you. You mentioned that on some days, marijuana helps you manage the demands of your work and art, but on others, it seems to take up a good portion of your day and you feel like you've missed out. It's clear that you care deeply about your creativity and productivity, and this is something that matters a lot to you. You also mentioned wanting to find that balance, which shows a real desire for change. Can you tell me more about what a balanced relationship with cannabis would look like for you and how that might fit with the other important aspects of your life, like being there for your art and for your family?

It sounds like your daily use is something that's on both your mind and your sister's, and it's brought you here today. You've mentioned that you've noticed an increase in your use lately, starting your day with it, which seems like a shift from before. It's clear that you care deeply about your work and maintaining a stable life, as well as being there for your family. You also value the ability to cope with challenging situations. It seems there's a part of you that's contemplating whether this daily use is aligning with those values or if it might be getting in the way of them. Have you noticed any moments or days when you've managed to go without cannabis and how you felt during those times?

Maya recognizes that her use has been escalating and is starting to cause problems in her life, but she also believes it helps her cope with stress and creative blocks. She is currently at the contemplation stage of change, acknowledging that her use might be a problem but not yet committing to making a change.

**Client:** I mean, I know I've been using a lot lately, like, more than I probably should. My friends keep saying I need to chill out, but it just helps me relax and get through the day, you know? I'm in art school, and sometimes the pressure is overwhelming, and it's like my escape. But then, I got stuck in a creative rut last weekend and couldn't even enjoy it. I realized I was too high to be productive. It's like this catch-22 where I use it to help me, but then it just takes over and I can't do anything. I guess I should probably figure out healthier ways to deal with stress, but it's hard to let go of something that'

Therapist: 👂 I hear you saying that your use has been a significant part of your daily routine and that it seems to be a tool for managing stress and creative blocks. It sounds like you're aware that your use has escalated, and it's causing some concerns, especially when it comes to productivity and the pressure you're feeling in art school. You've also noticed a pattern where the escape you're seeking from cannabis ends up being overshadowed by the very thing you're trying to escape. It can be really challenging to find that balance, and it's clear that you're thinking about how to navigate this tricky situation in a way that aligns with your other goals and values. You've already taken an important step by acknowledging the issue and considering healthier ways to cope. What are some of the values or aspirations that you feel might be impacted by your current use patterns?

Context: This session is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up at a community health clinic.

Therapist: Kai, I can see how challenging it must be to navigate this concern that your girlfriend has brought up about your cannabis use. It sounds like you're aware that it's become a daily routine, and you've noticed it's impacting your ability to stay focused on your tasks at work. You also mentioned feeling dependent on it as a way to unwind, which can be tough to confront. It's clear that you care about your productivity and relationships, and it seems like there's a part of you that's already considering how you might make some changes. You've even tried cutting back before and noticed the challenges that come with it, like feeling irritable and having trouble sleeping. It takes a lot of courage to recognize these patterns and to want to explore different ways to cope. Your desire to find a balance or to change your relationship with cannabis is something you can draw on as we talk more about what matters most to you, especially in

Context: During a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic, the therapist is working with Taylor, a 28-year-old barista and part-time graphic novel illustrator. Taylor has been struggling with daily marijuana use, primarily in the form of concentrates and edibles, which has been affecting his productivity and relationships. He recognizes that his use has escalated over the past year but is still ambivalent about making significant changes.

Client: "I guess I'm here because my girlfriend mentioned it after we got into another fight about my 'me time.' She thinks I'm using too much, but I don't know. It helps me unwind after a long day of work, you know? I mean, I don't want to lose her over this, but at the same time, I feel like it's the only thing that helps with my anxiety. I've been using in the mornings too, to get my creative juices flowing, and sometimes even before bed. But when she points out that I'm zoned out half the time, it makes me wonder if I'm really in control here."

Therapist: "It sounds like you're caught between wanting to maintain the benefits you feel marijuana provides and recognizing the impact it's having on your relationships and possibly your creativity. Can you tell me more about what you value most

You care deeply about your relationship with your girlfriend and you also want to manage your anxiety and find inspiration for your art. It's clear that marijuana has become a significant part of your daily routine, and it seems to be something that you're using both to unwind and to kickstart your creativity. At the same time, you're aware that it might be impacting your presence with your girlfriend and potentially affecting your productivity and relationships in ways that are concerning for you. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge these concerns and to consider how things might change if you were to find other ways to manage your anxiety and support your creative process. Can you tell me more about what has happened in the past when you've taken breaks from marijuana, or what your hopes might be if you were to explore different strategies for handling stress and finding inspiration?

**Context:** This session is a preliminary assessment at a community health clinic. The client, Taylor, is a 28-year-old barista living in an urban apartment with her partner and their young daughter. Taylor has been using cannabis daily, primarily in the form of edibles, for both medical reasons (chronic pain) and recreational purposes. She acknowledges that her use has increased over the past year and is beginning to experience some negative consequences at work and at home.

**Client:** "I guess I'm here because my partner noticed I've been a little 'out of it' lately, especially after I eat those edibles. She's worried about me, but honestly, I'm not sure I see the problem. I have chronic pain from an old injury, and weed really helps me manage it. It's only when I'm off work that I tend to overdo it, you know? But I can cut back if it's really that big of a deal."

**Therapist:** "It sounds like you're in a tough spot, Taylor. You're managing some significant pain and trying to balance that with your responsibilities as a parent and a partner. It's understandable that you rely on cannabis for relief. Can you tell me more about how you feel when you're using it daily versus times when you might use it less frequently?"

**Context:** This is a preliminary assessment session at a community health clinic. The client, Kendra, is a 27-year-old barista and single mother living in an urban apartment. She has been brought to the clinic by her concerned parents after they found paraphernalia in her home. Kendra uses cannabis primarily in the evenings to "unwind" from the stress of her job and parenting responsibilities, often turning to it daily after her daughter goes to bed. She acknowledges that her use has increased over the past year but is uncertain about its impact on her life.

**Client:** I guess I'm here because my folks are worried about me. I don't know, doc. I use weed every night, yeah, it's probably more than it should be. But it's the only thing that helps me relax after dealing with a full day of coffee orders and chasing after my kid. I mean, I love my daughter to bits, but she's an energetic three-year-old, and by the end of the day, I just need something to chill out. I know my parents are all, 'You're young, you can handle it,' but sometimes, I feel like I'm not handling anything well. And maybe I do use a little too much, but it's not like I'm out here breaking the law or anything, right?

You've also touched on the idea that you'd like to cut back, despite the challenges life presents that seem to make cannabis feel like a necessary coping strategy. Your reflections on these experiences show a deep level of self-awareness and understanding of the potential impact on your life and your family's life.

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic. The client, Carlos, is a 32-year-old construction worker who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates for pain management due to a recent injury on the job. He acknowledges that his use has increased over the past few months, leading to some concerns about his functioning at work and in his personal life.

**Client:** Look, I know my use has been high these days, especially with this back injury. I was using edibles and concentrates to manage the pain because I couldn't deal with the painkillers the doc prescribed. They made me feel out of it. But my girlfriend keeps nagging me about it. She says I'm high all the time now. It's like, I need something to help me cope, but she doesn't get that. I mean, I don't want to be this guy who's stoned all day, every day. It's just... sometimes I feel like I can't enjoy anything unless I'm high. But other times, I think maybe I've had enough and I should try to cut back. I guess I'm just stuck right

Therapist: ¡Hola Carlos, it sounds like you're really trying to navigate a challenging situation with your pain management and your girlfriend's concerns about your cannabis use. It can be tough to find the right balance, especially when you've been dealing with the discomfort from your injury. I hear you saying that while marijuana has been a coping strategy for you, there's also a part of you that notices the impact it's having on your daily life and relationships. It's quite common to have these mixed feelings as you consider how much you want this to be a part of your routine.

You've mentioned that at times, you feel like you can't fully enjoy things unless you're high, but then there are other moments when you think you might want to cut back. It seems like you're already exploring what might be most fulfilling for you. Can you tell me more about what a fulfilling life looks like for you,

Therapist: Elijah, it sounds like you're navigating a bit of tension between your own views on cannabis use and the concerns your girlfriend has brought up. It's clear that you value having a way to unwind after work, and it seems like cannabis plays a role in that routine for you. You mentioned that she's noticed changes in your interactions with her and your friends, which suggests that this aspect of your daily life might be more impactful than you initially thought. It's also important to recognize that while using cannabis is legal, it's how it affects our lives and relationships that truly matters.

You've brought up an essential point about the social context around relaxation and coping—many people find themselves in a similar situation where they turn to something as a way to manage stress. It's understandable that you might feel like cannabis is your go-to for relaxation, especially since it's legal and a common practice among

Ethan has been identified as being in the 'contemplation' stage of change, acknowledging that his use might be problematic but not yet committing to change. He comes from a middle-class background and has been using cannabis for both medical reasons (chronic back pain) and recreationally to unwind after work. His performance at work has recently declined, and his spouse has expressed concern about his marijuana use.

You mentioned that your wife's concerns have been on your mind since our last session, and it seems like you're already noticing the pattern of daily use. You've also recognized the potential for marijuana to serve as a way to numb out from life's demands, which shows a great deal of self-awareness. It's clear that you value your family and your career, and you've pointed out that there might be a disconnect between these values and your current use of cannabis. Can you tell me more about what changes you're hoping to see in your life that could align more closely with these values? How have things been different for you during the times when you've successfully managed to not use marijuana?

**Context:** During a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic, the client, Carlos, is a 32-year-old construction worker who has been experiencing increasing work-related stress. He has been using cannabis concentrates daily to "unwind" after his shifts. His partner has expressed concerns about his marijuana use, which has prompted him to seek help.

You care deeply about your job and finding a way to decompress after such demanding work, and at the same time, you recognize the importance of being fully present for your family. It's clear that your partner's concerns are coming from a place of love and her noticing 'you kind of spaced out' suggests she wants the best for all of you. It can be really challenging to manage the physical demands of your job and find healthy ways to unwind. You've already identified some key values in wanting to be an attentive dad, which seems to conflict with how the cannabis use might impact that role. Can you tell me more about a time when you felt like you were able to balance your need for relaxation with being there for your family?

You've also noted the physical pain and the challenge of finding restful sleep without relying on cannabis.

It's like this constant cycle—stress at work, smoke, feel better for a bit, then the stress is back and I smoke
Therapist: "It sounds like you're in a tough spot right now, Ethan, navigating between your own need for relaxation and the concerns of those close to you. It takes courage to recognize that there might be an impact on your productivity and relationships because of how often you're using marijuana. You mentioned that your girlfriend and parents have noticed your use and are concerned about it. It's clear that you care about their perspectives, even as you're questioning whether your use is at a level that needs to change.

You've also shared an important insight about the cycle of stress, using marijuana, and then facing the stress again. This pattern seems to be something you're aware of and concerned about, particularly since it led you to miss a work meeting—something that might have had serious consequences for your job.

**Context:** During a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic, the therapist is meeting with Eric, a 32-year-old construction worker who has been struggling with daily marijuana use. Eric has a history of chronic pain due to a work-related injury and has been using cannabis both for pain management and recreational purposes. He acknowledges that his use has increased over the past few months, leading to issues at work and strains in his relationship. The therapist notes that Eric is currently in the "contemplation" stage of change, as he recognizes there may be a problem but has not committed to making a change yet.

**Client:** "I guess I'm here because my old man said I should, you know? He thinks I'm turning into a pothead or something. But honestly, doc, what's the big deal? I've got this constant pain from my back, and it's the only thing that seems to help. And when I'm off work, it's like the only way I can relax and enjoy myself. It's not like I'm doing hard drugs or anything. But then, I saw my buddy lose his job because he tested positive on a random drug test. That could be me, and that's scary. I don't want to lose my job, but I also don't know

**Context:** During a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic, the therapist is meeting with Ben, a 32-year-old IT project manager who has been experiencing increased stress and anxiety at work. Ben has been using cannabis daily to cope with his symptoms, primarily in the form of edibles, which he believes helps him relax after long hours in front of the computer. His significant other has expressed concern about his marijuana use, prompting him to seek help. Ben is currently in the contemplation stage, acknowledging that his use might be problematic but also sees it as a necessary outlet.

You're describing a tough situation where you feel like the edibles are one of the few things helping you manage. It sounds like you care deeply about your work and the challenges it presents, and also about maintaining a healthy relationship with your girlfriend. It's clear that you're aware that your use is something she's concerned about, and that concern seems to be coming from a place of caring for you. Can you tell me more about what aspects of your life are most important to you right now, and how you see those aligning or potentially conflicting with your current use of cannabis? 🚫

The client, Carlos, is a 32-year-old construction worker who has been experiencing increased job-related stress. He reports daily marijuana use, primarily through smoking and vaping, for both medical reasons (chronic back pain from his job) and recreational purposes. Carlos acknowledges that his use has escalated recently, causing some concerns about his performance at work and his interactions with family and friends.

It sounds like the edibles are providing some relief for your pain and helping you get a full night's sleep, which is really important. At the same time, you're also aware of the impact it might be having on your clarity during the day and the financial strain it could be adding to your life. It takes a lot of courage to recognize these challenges and to consider making changes. You've been dealing with this for a while now, and it's natural to look for something that helps.

Context: The session is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up at a community health clinic. The client, Carlos, is a 32-year-old construction worker who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of concentrates and edibles. He reports daily use, citing chronic pain from a work-related injury as one of the reasons for his consumption. However, his partner has expressed concern about his dependency on marijuana, leading to increased conflict at home. Carlos acknowledges that his use might be problematic but feels trapped between managing his pain and fulfilling his responsibilities as a partner and future father. He is currently in the contemplation stage of change.

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load, trying to manage your chronic pain while also navigating the complexities of starting a family with your wife. You've noticed that your use has expanded beyond just pain management, and it's resonating with you that this might be impacting more than just the pain itself. The concern about your wife and the potential impact on your future family is really important. It's understandable that you're looking for ways to balance these different aspects of your life. You've already taken a significant step by acknowledging the potential conflict between your use and your aspirations as a father. Can you tell me more about what changes, if any, you've made in the past when it comes to your marijuana use, and what supported those changes?

Context: The session is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up at a community health clinic. The client, Carlos, is a 32-year-old construction worker who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of concentrates and edibles. He has been experiencing intermittent back pain due to his physically demanding job, for which he obtained a medical marijuana card. His use, however, has escalated over the past few months, and his partner has expressed concern about his dependency on cannabis. Carlos acknowledges that his use is affecting his productivity at work and his personal relationships but feels that he needs cannabis to manage his pain. He is currently in the "contemplation" stage of change.

Client: "Look, I know my wife's worried, and I've seen some of her points, you know? She says I'm using too much, that it's becoming a problem. But man, this pain is no joke.

I tried cutting back, but the pain gets unbearable, and honestly, it's not just the physical relief. I enjoy the high, too. It's my downtime, my thing after a long day.

Therapist: ¡Hola Carlos, it sounds like you're carrying a real heavy load with your pain and the concerns from your wife. It's clear that you've noticed the impact of your cannabis use on both your physical well-being and your family life. You've also shared that there are times when you've seen things differently, recognizing some of your wife's points about your use. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge these concerns and to reflect on how your use might be interfering with the activities and relationships that are important to you.

You mentioned trying to cut back on your use but feeling like the pain becomes unmanageable without it. It's understandable that you're looking for ways to cope with the discomfort you experience after a long day at work. And it's also really meaningful that you value family time and have realized that your use might be getting in the way of that.

The client, Elijah, is a 32-year-old freelance software developer who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates. He has come to the clinic after his girlfriend expressed concerns about his recent increase in use, particularly on weekends when he often loses track of time and neglects household responsibilities. Elijah acknowledges that his use might be a problem but feels conflicted because he also uses cannabis to manage stress from his high-pressure job. He is currently in the contemplation stage, recognizing that his use has escalated but not yet committed to making a change.

Therapist: Elijah, it sounds like you're aware that your recent increase in cannabis use has led to some challenges, particularly with how it impacts your time and responsibilities on weekends. You also mentioned how your girlfriend's concerns have become a noticeable issue for her. It seems like you recognize the potential productivity loss and the conflict it creates, not just for yourself but also within your relationship. You've also highlighted the paradox of finding cannabis both helpful for managing work stress yet recognizing that it can lead to unintended consequences when used in excess. It's clear that you care deeply about your role as a software developer and as a partner, and it seems like these roles might be in tension with your current use of cannabis. Can you tell me more about what aspects of your life are most important to you right now, and how they align with or perhaps differ from your current patterns of use?

Context: The session is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up at a community health clinic. The client, Daniel, is a 32-year-old software developer who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles on a daily basis. He's been experiencing increased anxiety and work-related stress, which he self-medicates with marijuana. His partner has expressed concerns about his daily use, prompting him to seek help. Daniel is currently at the contemplation stage, recognizing that his use might be problematic but hasn't yet committed to making a change.

Client: "I guess I'm here because my partner pushed me to come. I know I've been using edibles pretty much every day after work. It helps me unwind, you know? But my partner says it's become a problem. I mean, I don't think I'm addicted; I can stop anytime I want. But then, when I try to skip a day, I feel this intense anxiety creeping up. Like, what if I can't handle the stress without it? What if I just can't enjoy anything without being high? That's when I start to worry if I'm really in control here."

Therapist: 🤝 I can understand how challenging it must be to balance unwinding after work with the concerns your partner has raised about your daily use. It sounds like you're at a point where you're looking for ways to manage the stress without relying on marijuana every day, even though it feels like a crutch right now. You've noticed that when you try to take a break, the anxiety can feel intense, which makes sense given how regularly you've been using it. It's also commendable that you're reflecting on whether you're in control of your use or if it's controlling you. Many people come to similar realizations as they think about their relationship with cannabis.

You mentioned that you believe you can stop anytime, and that's a powerful belief to hold onto. It reflects your autonomy and capacity for change. At the same time, it's also okay to acknowledge that change can sometimes be harder

Therapist: It sounds like you're really caught between two important aspects of your life—managing your pain and maintaining the relationships and responsibilities that are also very important to you. You've noticed the impact that your use has on both, and that's concerning for you. It's clear that you're not just using for the high, but for relief from your chronic injury. That's a significant part of why you turn to cannabis, and I can see how that would be a difficult cycle to break. You've also mentioned that you don't want to become someone who is defined by their cannabis use, and that you're worried about the pain when you're not using. It seems like there's a part of you that's already thinking about how things could be different, as you've successfully navigated periods without use in the past. Can you tell me more about what helped you manage your pain during those times?

**Context:** During a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic, the therapist meets with Tyler, a 32-year-old construction worker who has been struggling with daily marijuana use. Tyler has a history of chronic pain due to injuries sustained on the job, and he uses cannabis both for pain management and recreationally after work. In the previous session, Tyler expressed some concerns about his heavy use but also defended it as necessary for coping with his pain and stress. The therapist noted that Tyler was in the "contemplation" stage of change.

**Client:** (Tyler) Look, I know I've been smoking a lot, and my girlfriend's been on my case about cutting back. She says it's affecting my mood, but honestly, I don't know what to do without it. The pain's always there, you know? And after a long day on the site, it's like the only thing that helps me unwind and not think about all the aches. But then, I also feel kinda foggy the next day, and I've missed a couple of days with her because I was too high. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle, and I don't like where it's leading, but I also can't imagine not having it at the end of the day.

Therapist: "Tyler, it sounds like you're really aware of the impact your marijuana use has been having on your life and relationships, especially with how it's affecting your mood and the time you spend with your girlfriend. You mentioned feeling 'foggy' the next day and missing out on time with her because of your use. Those are some clear signs that you're noticing the effects of your routine. It's also really clear how much the pain from your injuries is a challenge, and you've been relying on cannabis to manage that. It can be really tough to find alternatives that work just as well. You've also brought up some important values, like being present for your girlfriend and managing your mood effectively. These are things that you clearly care about deeply.

Context: During a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic, the therapist meets with Carlos, a 32-year-old construction worker who has been grappling with daily marijuana use. Carlos has come to the clinic after missing his last appointment, citing a busy work schedule.

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load with your work and managing ongoing back pain, which can really take its toll. I can see how you might be looking for that relief at the end of the day, and it's clear that your partner cares about you and the changes they've noticed in your routine. You mentioned that you don't want to lose your connection with them or find yourself in a difficult financial situation because of your cannabis use. It seems like there's a real importance you place on both your health and your relationship, which can sometimes be at odds with your current use. Can you tell me more about what these values mean to you and how they might guide the changes you're looking to make?

Therapist: "Trevor, it sounds like you're really tuning into some important insights about how your marijuana use might be impacting both your work and your stress levels. It's clear that you value being able to unwind after a challenging day at the office, and it seems like cannabis has been a part of that routine. You also mentioned the concern about missing deadlines due to highness—that's a significant issue that aligns with some of the concerns your employer has raised. It takes courage to recognize these moments where things aren't working quite as you'd like them to.

You've clearly identified a pattern where your use is interfering with your work, which is a key area in your life. And it's also heartening to hear that you care about handling stress without the substance. You've mentioned before that you want to be more present for your kids and at work, which seems to be in conflict with how much

That's a really important observation, and it reflects a clear concern you have about how your use aligns with the life and productivity you value.

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a bit of concern from your girlfriend's perspective on how cannabis use might be influencing your experiences and perhaps even your sense of self. You mentioned feeling 'spaced out' and less present, which seems to resonate with some of her observations. It's also clear that you value being able to manage stress and find relaxation through using marijuana on the weekends. It's understandable that this is something you turn to after a intense workweek. In our previous conversations, you've also touched on how important your role as a software developer is to you, and how crucial it is to maintain your focus and productivity at work. It seems there might be a tension between the desire to relax and manage stress and the aspiration to remain fully engaged and productive during those times when you're not using. Can you tell me more about what might help you navigate that tension without relying on cannabis?

You also mentioned not wanting to be dependent on anything, which is a powerful insight and reflects a lot of self-awareness.

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic. The client, Daniel, is a 32-year-old software developer who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates. He has come to recognize that his daily use, which began as a way to manage anxiety, may have escalated into a pattern that's affecting his personal and professional life. Daniel is currently in the contemplation stage, acknowledging that his use might be problematic but is not yet ready to commit to change.

**Client:** "I guess I'm here because my partner mentioned I've been kind of... out of it lately. You know? I use cannabis to relax after work, and it helps me unwind. But she says I'm using too much, that I'm high all the time. I don't know, doc. Maybe she's right. It's just that when I don't use, I feel this tightness in my chest, like anxiety is creeping back in. I don't want to go back to feeling that way all the time. But at the same time, I'm tired of her giving me this look like I'm throwing my life away. It's not like I'm doing hard drugs or anything."

Therapist: It sounds like you're aware that your partner has noticed a change in how much you're using cannabis and that it's been a concern for both of you. You mentioned that you use it to relax after work, and it seems to be an important part of your routine for unwinding. At the same time, you've noticed that when you don't use, you feel this anxiety creeping back in, which is understandably unsettling. It's also clear that you care about how your partner perceives your use and the impact it might have on your relationship. You value their perspective and want to address this issue thoughtfully. Can you tell me more about what changing your marijuana use looks like from your point of view? How do you envision navigating this tension between relaxation and managing anxiety without cannabis?

**Context:** During a motivational interviewing (MI) session at an outpatient addiction treatment clinic, the therapist is meeting with Maya, a 32-year-old self-employed event planner who has been experiencing increasing difficulties in her personal and professional life. Maya has been using cannabis daily to manage stress but acknowledges that it might be contributing to her problems. She has attended one session previously and is currently in the "Contemplation" stage of change.

You've noticed that after using cannabis, you sometimes feel like the day has slipped by, which seems to be a concern for both you and your partner.

Context: This session is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up at a community health clinic. The client, Carlos, is a 38-year-old construction project manager who has been using cannabis predominantly in the form of edibles and concentrates. He has been experiencing increased stress at work and has turned to marijuana as a way to unwind. Carlos's wife has expressed concerns about his use, but he has largely dismissed her worries, believing he has his use under control. During the initial assessment, Carlos was identified as being in the contemplation stage of change, recognizing that his use might be problematic but not yet committed to making a change.

Client: Look, I know my wife thinks I'm using too much, and maybe I do sometimes. But you gotta understand, construction is a high-stress job, and I need something to relax after a long day. It's not like I'm out there doing anything dangerous or irresponsible. I just like the way it helps me unwind. But I also know she's noticed I've been more forgetful, missing some things at work, maybe it is affecting me more than I thought. I don't want to lose her, you know? She's my rock.

Therapist: ¡Hola Carlos, it sounds like you're carrying a pretty heavy load with your work and the stress that comes with it. It's understandable that you're looking for ways to unwind after such a demanding day. And it's also really clear how much your relationship with your wife means to you. You mentioned noticing some changes in your memory, which seems to have caught both your attention and that of your wife. It's quite insightful of you to recognize this and consider its impact on your life.

You've shared a lot about the role cannabis plays in helping you manage stress, and it's important that we understand how valuable that can feel. At the same time, it's also significant that you're concerned about how your use might be affecting not just your work performance but also your relationship with your wife. It seems like a part of you is already thinking about how you could demonstrate to her that you're capable

Therapist: Teresa, it sounds like you're really at a crossroads right now, trying to reconcile your need for relaxation with concerns about how your use might be impacting your professional life and perhaps even your memory and learning. It's clear that you care deeply about teaching, and it seems like the thought of any potential negative effects of cannabis on your job—and on your ability to be fully present for your students—is really weighing on you. You've noticed a connection between your use and how you're feeling at work, and that's an important observation. It takes courage to consider making changes when there's something that seems to help you unwind after such a demanding day. Can you tell me more about what you value most in your role as a teacher and how you see those values aligning with or perhaps conflicting with your current use of cannabis?

Context: This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, Tina, is a 38-year-old school librarian who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles on a daily basis for stress relief from her demanding job. She has acknowledged concerns about her use during an initial assessment a month ago and has returned for a follow-up to discuss her progress and challenges. Tina's use has escalated recently, leading to noticeable impairments in her professional responsibilities and personal relationships.

Client: "I guess I should cut back, you know? My boss noticed I wasn't as sharp during storytime last week, and my sister keeps nagging me about it. But honestly, without weed, the day just drags on, and I can't deal with all the noise and the kids. It's like my escape. I don't want to lose my job or hurt my relationship with my sis, but sometimes, I just can't face the day without it. And the pain—I get these migraines, and edibles are one of the few things that help."

Therapist: "It sounds like you're in a really tough spot, Tina, trying to manage both your stress and the physical pain you're experiencing. It's understandable that you've been looking to cannabis for relief

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load with your job and the expectations that come with it, Tina. I can imagine how challenging it must be to manage the demands of storytime, especially when you're not feeling at your best. And it's clear how much your use has become a part of your daily routine for coping. You mentioned how your boss and sister have noticed changes in your behavior, which shows that your use is having an impact on your professional life and personal relationships. It's also touching to hear you talk about wanting to be sharp and present for the children during storytime and to maintain a healthy relationship with your sister. These are important values to you, and it seems like there's a tension between these values and your current marijuana use. Can you tell me more about what changes you might want to make that could align better with these values?

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, Kendra, is a 28-year-old single mother working as a freelance graphic artist. She has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates for the past two years, initially to help with anxiety and chronic pain. Lately, her use has escalated, and she's starting to notice negative effects on her life, particularly concerning her parenting responsibilities. Kendra is currently in the Contemplation stage of change regarding her marijuana use.

It helps me relax after dealing with my kid all day and the deadlines for my work. But sometimes, like last weekend, I can't stop. I end up not getting anything done because I'm just... lost in it.

You've noticed times when your use has escalated, leading to feelings of guilt and concern about the impact on your daughter. It's really important to hear you say that you're contemplating whether your current level of use aligns with the kind of mother and role model you want to be. Can you tell me more about what aspects of your life as a parent and professional are most important to you, and how your use aligns or perhaps doesn't align with those values?

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic. The client, Carlos, is a 32-year-old construction worker who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of concentrates and edibles. He has been experiencing increasing work-related stress due to the demands of his job, which he manages by using marijuana at the end of each day. His girlfriend has expressed concerns about his use, but he has been resistant to change, citing that cannabis helps him unwind and cope with his anxiety.

You've also mentioned how deeply she cares about you, which shows how much what you do affects those around you. It can be really tough to find other ways to unwind when you've been relying on marijuana for so long. I've heard you talk about the stress from your job and how you feel like you need it to relax. It seems like a big part of you values being there for your girlfriend as well, and that's something you're working to balance. Can you tell me more about what a day without cannabis might look like for you, or perhaps share a time when you felt relaxed or in control without using?

The client, Marcus, is a 38-year-old construction foreman who has been using marijuana daily to manage chronic pain from an injury on the job. He acknowledges that his use has escalated over the past year, and his partner has expressed concerns about his dependency. Marcus has attended this follow-up session to discuss his progress since the initial assessment, where he was identified as being in the "contemplation" stage of change.

Client: Look, I know my usage has been up lately, and my old man's been giving me grief about it. He says I'm hooked, but I don't think that's fair. It's not like I'm doing hard drugs or anything. I just can't handle the pain without it, you know? And on weekends, it's different; I enjoy it with my buddies after work. It's our thing. But first thing in the morning, every day? That's a bit much when you put it that way. I guess I never really thought about cutting back until now. My partner's right; we've had this talk before. I want to be there for her, for us, but this pain, man... it's relentless. And sometimes, I feel like I can't face

Therapist: It sounds like you're aware that your use has increased and that it's been a point of concern not just for you but also for your partner and your father. You've noticed the pattern of using first thing in the morning every day, and you've acknowledged that this might be more than just 'our thing' on weekends. It's clear that managing your chronic pain is a significant factor in your use, and it's also clear how much you value being there for your partner and for yourself. You've brought up some important points about the balance between coping with pain and living a life that aligns with your deeper values. Can you tell me more about what those values are and how they might be impacted by your current use of marijuana?

Context: The session is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up at a community health clinic. The client, Daniel, is a 32-year-old IT project manager who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates for stress relief from work. He has acknowledged concerns about his use during the initial assessment but has shown mixed feelings about changing his habits. Daniel lives with his partner and they are both aware of his marijuana use, though it sometimes leads to conflicts.

Client: "I mean, I know you're gonna ask about my weed use, right? Look, I get it's not the healthiest thing, especially how I've been doing it lately—those dabs can be intense. But here's the thing: work is just crazy. I'm under constant pressure, and without something to chill out, I'd be a total mess. My partner gets mad sometimes, says I'm using it as an escape.

Context: This session is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up at a community health clinic. The client, Carlos, is a 38-year-old construction supervisor who has been using marijuana primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates. He reports daily use to manage chronic pain from an old injury sustained on the job. His partner has expressed concerns about his marijuana use, but Carlos sees it as a necessary part of his daily routine. He's been referred by his occupational health provider after a recent incident where he was found incompetent on a construction site due to impaired cognition. The clinician has identified Carlos as being in the 'contemplation' stage of change regarding his marijuana use.

Client: "Look, I know my partner and the doc are worried about my weed use, and I get it—they think I'm dependent or something. But it's not like that. I just can't function without it; the pain is unbearable without it. I've been thinking though, maybe I've been relying on it a bit too much. I mean, I don't go looking for trouble when it's not there, but if I'm honest, I guess I do reach for it more than I should. It's just that without it, I can't even think straight half the time.

Therapist: It sounds like you're aware that your partner and your occupational health provider have concerns about your marijuana use, and it's clear you're also reflecting on this yourself. You mentioned that you think you might be relying on it more than you intended. It can be really challenging to manage chronic pain without something that provides relief. I hear you expressing a desire to function without the need for weed, especially when it comes to thinking clearly. You've also brought up the idea of not wanting to be dependent on it. It seems like there's an important value for you around being present and functioning well, both for yourself and for your family. Can you tell me more about what this means for you and how it might fit with your goals?

Context: This session is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up at a community health clinic. The client, Trevor, is a 38-year-old IT project manager who has been experiencing increased stress and anxiety at work. He initially sought help due to concerns from his spouse about his daily marijuana use, which he had justified as a coping mechanism for work-related stress. Trevor's use has recently led to some noticeable health issues, and he is currently in the 'contemplation' stage of change regarding his cannabis consumption.

Client: "Look, I know my wife's worried, and I've been reading up on that whole 'cannabis-induced respiratory thing.' It's got me thinking, you know? I mean, I do feel like my use has crept up on me—I'm vaping all day long 'to manage' the work crap. But at the same time, it's not like I'm doing hard drugs, right? It's natural, and in some states, it's even legal for recreational use. I guess I can see how it might be a problem if I'm honest with myself, but I also don't want to feel this constant pressure from everyone around me. What if I just set some boundaries and stick to edibles on the weekends? That seems like a reasonable compromise,

It's quite common for people to seek ways to cope with high levels of stress, and it's also common to question whether the methods we use are helping or perhaps even contributing to that stress in the long run. You've already

The client, Carlos, is a 38-year-old construction project manager who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates. He reports daily use for stress relief and to enhance his social life on weekends. Recently, his performance at work has declined, and he's been experiencing anxiety and mood swings that concern both him and his family. Carlos is identified as being in the "contemplation" stage of change regarding his marijuana use.

Therapist: ¡Hola, Carlos! It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden with the changes you've been experiencing at work and at home. I can understand how challenging it must be to feel that the cannabis is both a source of relief and a contributing factor to these difficulties. You mentioned feeling out of control and concerned about the impact on your role as a father and in your career. It's clear that you value your family and your work, and it seems like your use might be at odds with those values at times. You also brought up the concern your sister had, which led you to seek help today. It's not uncommon for someone to feel labeled or pressured when someone close to them expresses this kind of worry. How have these experiences been for you, and what are your thoughts about how cannabis fits into the life you want for yourself and your family?

Context: The session is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up at a community health clinic. The client, Samuel, is a 32-year-old software engineer who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles on a near-daily basis for stress relief from a high-pressure job. He has acknowledged concerns about his use during the initial assessment but has shown mixed feelings about changing his habits. Samuel comes from a middle-class background and lives with his partner and their young child. Recently, he's been experiencing mild anxiety and has had several conflicts at home regarding his cannabis use.

Client: "Look, I know you're trying to help me out here, and I appreciate that. It's just... you know, this job, it's a lot.

I can understand why it might feel challenging to navigate that pressure without the support of cannabis, especially when it comes to being fully present for your child. Your partner's concerns about your use and the impact it might be having are definitely worth considering—it seems like there's a disconnect between how you want to be as a parent and how you feel your use is aligning with those aspirations. You've also mentioned some health concerns that have come up recently, which could be another important aspect to reflect on. It's clear that you value your role as a parent and a partner, and it seems like there might be a tension between these values and your current cannabis use.

**Context:** During a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic, the client, Carlos, is a 32-year-old software engineer who has been experiencing increased work stress due to tight project deadlines. He started using cannabis primarily for relaxation and sleep aid about a year ago but has recently noticed that his use has escalated to daily vaping. Carlos acknowledges that his use might be problematic but is hesitant to change his routine as it's the only way he feels he can cope with his stress. He comes from a socioeconomically stable background and lives with his partner in a suburban area.

**Client:** "I guess I should cut back, you know? My friends are all using it, and it's like our thing. But I can't deny that it's taking over my life. I vape first thing in the morning, after work, before bed—it's like a cycle I can't break. I use it to unwind, but then I'm too tired to be productive the next day. It's like this never-ending loop. I do feel anxious without it, though. Like, what if I can't handle the stress without getting high? What if I just can't sleep? These thoughts scare me, but the idea of not using it is even scarier."

Therapist: ¡Hola Carlos, it sounds like you're sitting with some significant thoughts about your cannabis use and its impact on your daily life. It's clear that you value your friendships and the shared experiences they bring, but it also seems like you're noticing how your use is becoming a more dominant part of your routine than you'd like. You've picked up on how this cycle might be affecting your productivity and your ability to handle stress without turning to cannabis. It's really brave of you to acknowledge these concerns.

You mentioned feeling anxious about the possibility of not using marijuana, and how that thought is scary for you. It's understandable that the idea of facing stress without the support of cannabis can be daunting. You also talked about the fears around sleep and relaxation without it. It's important to hear that these feelings are valid and common among people who are considering changing their marijuana use.

You mentioned feeling like you're 'zoned out' during moments that could be more engaging or fulfilling without the cannabis, and you've noticed the impact it's having on your performance at work. It's also poignant that your girlfriend brought up her concerns, as these are often signs that a change might be beneficial not just for you but for your relationship as well.

You've also shared that you've had moments where you've felt the desire and perhaps even taken steps towards reducing your use, like when you wished you could stop and not feel off or on edge. These are important insights into what might be more aligned with your values and goals for yourself, both as a professional and as a partner.

It's clear that you've been relying on cannabis as a way to manage stress and sleep, which has become more frequent than perhaps you intended. You also shared that there's a part of you that feels it might be time for a change, despite the understandable apprehension about facing life without it as an 'escape.' It takes courage to recognize these patterns and consider making a shift. Can you tell me more about what changes you've been thinking about or any steps you've already taken in this direction?

You also mentioned that you've experienced some benefits from not using, like being more present or focused. Can you tell me more about those times when you found that not using worked well for you? It might help us explore how you can create more of those experiences in your life.

Trevor acknowledges that his performance at work has been affected, and he's starting to experience some health concerns, including anxiety and difficulty sleeping. He is in the "contemplation" stage of change.
Client: Look, I know my use has been up lately, especially with the new job. It's like I come home, and it's almost an automatic thing—I grab an edible or hit the vape pen. But honestly, I think it helps me unwind. I mean, coding all day is intense, and sometimes, I feel like I can't function without it. On the other hand, I've been feeling pretty guilty about it lately. My girlfriend's been on my case about cutting back, saying it's affecting how I am at home, too. I guess I can see that. But man, it's hard. I don't know if I can just stop after all this time. It's not like I'm doing hard drugs or anything, right?
Therapist: It sounds like you're aware of the changes in your use, especially with the new demands of your job, and it's been quite a shift to have it become such an automatic part of your routine at home. You also mentioned feeling guilty about how your use might be impacting your relationship and your own well-being. It's clear that you care deeply about these aspects of your life, and it seems like there's a conflict between what you're experiencing with your marijuana use and the values that are important to you as a partner and a professional. You've also noticed some health concerns, like anxiety and sleep difficulties, which might be signs that this pattern could be affecting your overall health and happiness. It takes courage to recognize these issues and consider making changes. Can you tell me more about what changes you feel might be possible or what goals you have for yourself that could align with reducing your marijuana use?

The client, Jordan, is a 29-year-old software developer who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates for relaxation after work. He has come to recognize that his use has been increasing, and his performance at work has started to suffer. Jordan identifies as being in the contemplation stage of change regarding his marijuana use.

**Client:** I don't know, maybe I do use a bit too much. My friends and I will often grab an edible or dab after work to unwind. It helps me relax, you know? But my boss has been on my case lately about missing deadlines. He thinks I'm not up to par because of it. I can see how he might think that, but I feel like if I just managed my time better, everything would be fine. It's not like I'm doing hard drugs or anything. It's just weed. But I guess I could see how it might be a problem if I'm missing out on work because of it. I don't want to lose my job over this.

You mentioned that your stomach has been troubling you for a while, and you're wondering if it might be related to your use—that's definitely something to consider. It's clear that finding a way to relax is important for you, and it seems like your use has become a consistent part of your routine for that purpose. You've also been doing some thinking about the possibility that this routine might not be as beneficial as you once thought. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that there might be an issue and to explore different ways to care for yourself after work. Your commitment to exploring this further is a big step, and I'm here to support you through that process.

You mentioned that sometimes you lose track of how much you've consumed, which can be a bit unsettling. It seems like you value your ability to unwind after a long day of work, and you're concerned about the impact your use might be having at work, especially with those 'out there' ideas that have been more frequent. You also hold a strong sense of yourself as creative, which is an important part of who you are as a software engineer. It can be really challenging to find balance, especially when trying to manage stress and maintain productivity. From what you're sharing, it seems like you're already thinking about how your use might be connected to this creativity, as well as the potential for it to impact your work and personal life.

Therapist: I can understand how complex your relationship with cannabis is; it seems like it's both a source of comfort and a challenge for you. You mentioned that your sister brought up your social media posts related to cannabis, which suggests she cares about you and might be concerned about how often you're using. It sounds like you've noticed the impact of your use on your routine, especially with missing your workouts. It's not uncommon for people to turn to something that helps them unwind after a long day, but it seems like you're also looking for more balance in your life. You've expressed a desire for change, both to improve your sleep and to manage your time differently. Your concern about missing out on important activities due to your use reflects a deeper value of being present and active, which is really important. Can you tell me more about what being present means to you and how your cannabis use might be getting in the way of that?

The client, Jordan, is a 29-year-old software developer who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates for both medical reasons (chronic back pain from a sports injury) and recreational use. His use has recently escalated, leading to increased absences from work and some concerns from his partner about his behavior when under the influence. Jordan identifies as being in the Contemplation stage of change, acknowledging that his use might be a problem but not yet committed to making a change.
Client: I guess I'm here because my partner mentioned something about my 'weed problem.' I don't know if it's a problem, though. I mean, I use it to help with my back pain from that old injury, and it definitely helps me relax after a long day of coding. But sometimes, I might take an edible in the morning before work, and then I'm just all over the place, can't focus. And yeah, I've missed a few days at the office, but who doesn't need a day off, right? It's not like I'm doing hard drugs or anything. My brother has a medical card, and it's legal here for recreational use too. So, I don't know if what I
Therapist: It sounds like you're grappling with some complex feelings about your marijuana use, especially in light of your partner's concerns and the impact it's having on your work. You've mentioned that sometimes the edibles or concentrates can interfere with your focus and productivity, which tells me that you're aware of how it can affect your daily functioning. You also value the relief it provides for your chronic back pain and the way it helps you unwind after a long day. It's clear that you care deeply about your well-being and your role as a software developer, as well as your responsibilities at home.

You mentioned that you've missed a few days at work, which seems to be concerning for you as well. Can you tell me more about what you hope for in your life, especially considering your goals and the values that are important to you? How does your current use align with those hopes and values?

**Context:** During a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic, the therapist is meeting with Trevor, a 29-year-old software developer who has been experiencing increased work stress and has turned to marijuana to cope. Trevor initially sought help after his girlfriend expressed concern about his daily cannabis use. He is currently in the contemplation stage of change, acknowledging that his use might be a problem but also feeling conflicted about changing a habit that has become a significant part of his routine.

**Client:** "I guess I can see where you're coming from about cutting back, you know? My boss has been riding me hard with these deadlines, and the only time I feel like I can relax is after I smoke. But my girl mentioned it might be a problem, and I don't want to lose her. She's the best thing that's ever happened to me. Still, when I get home from work, I just can't shake the feeling that I need it to unwind. It's like my escape. But then, I look at old photos of us, and I think, 'How much longer until this is all I do?' It's like there's this constant battle inside me—the part that knows I should probably chill with the weed and the part that just wants to light up and forget about everything."

Therapist: It sounds like you're really caught between two parts of yourself—one that deeply values the relaxation and escape marijuana provides after a tough day at work, and another part that deeply cares for your relationship with your girlfriend and doesn't want to lose her. It's clear that you've noticed this conflict and it's weighing heavily on you. You're not alone in experiencing this tension; many people find themselves in similar situations. It's also heartening to hear that you've recognized the potential problem with your use and are thinking about how it aligns—or doesn't—with what's most important to you, like your relationship with your girlfriend and your future together. Can you tell me more about what those values look like for you and how your current use might be affecting them?

**Context:** This session is a follow-up to the initial assessment at a community health clinic, where it was determined that Tyler, a 29-year-old software developer, has a marijuana use disorder. He's been using cannabis daily, primarily in the form of edibles and vaping devices, to manage stress from work and to enhance social experiences with friends. Tyler acknowledges that his use has escalated over the past year, leading to some performance issues at work and strains in his relationships. He is currently in the 'Contemplation' stage of change, recognizing that there are problems related to his marijuana use but not yet committed to taking action.

Therapist: It sounds like you've been aware of your girlfriend's concerns and also noticed changes in your own routine since your use has increased. You mentioned the challenges with bill payments and punctuality for meetings, which could be quite distressing, especially if they align with your values around responsibility and reliability. It seems like this is an area where you're feeling some tension between what you're experiencing and what you want for yourself, particularly in terms of being present and effective at work and in your relationships. You've also acknowledged that your use has been a way to unwind from the demands of coding, which tells me you're someone who's thoughtful about managing stress. Can you share more about what it might look like for you to find other ways to cope with the pressures at work that don't involve cannabis? And how do you see those changes aligning with your broader goals and values in life?

**Context:** During a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic, the therapist is meeting with Daniel, a 29-year-old software developer who has been struggling with heavy weekend cannabis use. He initially sought help due to concerns from his partner about his increasing reliance on marijuana to unwind and cope with stress from work. Daniel has been identified as being in the "contemplation" stage of change, acknowledging that his use may be a problem but not yet committed to making a change.

You've brought up some important points about how this is impacting your life and your goals, which shows a lot of self-awareness and willingness to consider these challenges.

You've also talked about wanting to find better ways to cope, and that's a significant first step. It's not uncommon to seek out ways to unwind after a long week, but it seems like you're ready to explore

Context: This is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic. The client, Taylor, is a 29-year-old graphic designer who has been experiencing increased stress and anxiety in her job. She initially sought help after her partner expressed concern about her daily marijuana use, which she had started using for relaxation but has noticed is becoming more of a crutch. During the initial assessment, it was determined that Taylor's use could be leading to a cannabis use disorder, given the frequency and impact on her daily functioning.

Therapist: 👂 I heard you say that this change has left your evenings feeling silent and boring, and it's been tough to find that sense of relaxation without marijuana. It sounds like you're really missing that wind-down ritual after work, and it's been a challenge to adapt to these new evenings. You also mentioned the discomfort of being on edge without using over the weekends, which you've recognized in photos from last weekend. It's clear that this is more than just a simple choice at this point; it's about finding a balance that feels right for you and aligns with your values as a partner and a parent.

It seems like this is something you're already reflecting on, feeling both its benefits and its challenges. You've mentioned how it helps you manage stress, but you're also tired of the constant haze it creates in your day-to-day life. This loop you're describing—it's clear that you're looking for a different way to cope, one that aligns with your goals and values, especially as a parent and professional. Can you tell me more about what those goals are and how marijuana use fits into the picture?

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, Carlos, is a 29-year-old software engineer who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates on a near-daily basis for stress relief from his high-pressure job. He has come to recognize that his use might be problematic but feels caught between the benefits it provides and the potential negative impacts on his life. Carlos is in the Contemplation stage of change, acknowledging that his use has escalated over the past year.

**Client:** You know, I guess I've been thinking a lot about this lately. I mean, I use cannabis to chill out after work because my job is so stressful, and it definitely helps me unwind. But my friends mentioned that I'm kind of zoned out when I'm high nowadays, and sometimes I even forget what I'm doing. It's like I'm not really there. That worries me a bit, you know? But at the same time, without it, I just feel so wound up, and I don't know how else to cope. It's my only outlet.

Therapist: ¡Hola Carlos, it sounds like you're really tuning into some important observations about your cannabis use and how it's affecting you. It can be quite revealing to hear feedback from friends, especially when they notice changes in our behavior that might be concerning. You mentioned feeling worried about those moments when you feel 'zoned out,' and that's a significant insight. It's clear you value your relationships and connection with others, and it seems like there's a conflict between maintaining those connections and the way cannabis is currently part of your routine.

You also highlighted the challenge of finding alternative ways to manage the stress from your job. It's understandable that you're looking for that 'outlet' and how cannabis has become a go-to for you. It's not uncommon for people to seek out something that helps them relax, but it's also important to consider what other strategies might support you in finding that balance without

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic. The client, Tina, is a 29-year-old bartender who has been experiencing intermittent difficulty in her relationship due to her marijuana use. She was referred by her primary care physician after a routine check-up revealed mild liver enzyme elevation potentially linked to cannabis use. Tina falls into the 'contemplation' stage of change, as she acknowledges her use is problematic but has not yet committed to making a change.

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying quite a bit on your shoulders between your work environment and the dynamic at home. It's understandable that you're looking for ways to decompress after such an intense day. You mentioned that your girlfriend has noticed your cannabis use and it seems to be a point of contention for both of you. It's clear that you care deeply about this relationship and you're not wanting to feel like you're 'escaping' from it, but rather finding a healthier way to manage the stress you're feeling. You also mentioned last time how your liver enzyme levels are something that's concerning for you, especially given the potential link to cannabis use. It seems like you've been reflecting on these issues and their impact on different aspects of your life. Can you tell me more about what changes, if any, you might be considering in light of these concerns?

Context: This is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic. The client, Dante, is a 52-year-old construction foreman who has been experiencing increased work stress and intermittent back pain, which he manages primarily with cannabis concentrates. He initially sought help due to concerns from his spouse about his daily marijuana use. During the initial assessment, it was determined that Dante was in the "contemplation" stage of change.

I mean, I start my day with a dab, and it helps me get through the pain without popping pills all day. And by the evening, it helps me unwind after dealing with the chaos on site. It's not like I'm out here doing anything crazy. But I'll admit, sometimes I forget what I'm even supposed to be remembering about my back pain when I haven't had my session. It's a cycle, isn't it?

During the initial assessment, it was identified that Taylor's marijuana use had escalated from occasional weekend use to daily vaping, primarily using concentrates. She has been experiencing increasing anxiety and has missed several days of work recently. The clinician has noted that Taylor is in the "Contemplation" stage of change, acknowledging that her use may be problematic but not yet committing to a change.

You've also noticed some concerns about how it might affect your life if left unchecked.

Therapist: David, it sounds like you're aware of the changes in your use and the impact it's having on different areas of your life, including at work and during family events. It's not uncommon to turn to something we enjoy, like cannabis, as a way to unwind or escape stress. You mentioned that your partner has noticed these changes too, which shows me that this isn't just something you're experiencing alone. It's really important to think about how these choices align with the values you hold as a parent, a professional, and a partner. You've also pointed out that while it's not hard drugs, it's still a substance that's affecting your life in significant ways.

He has come to the clinic after his partner expressed concern about his recent increase in usage on weekends, which seems to be affecting his performance at work and his interactions with his teenage children. Marcus acknowledges that he might have a problem but is unsure if change is necessary or even possible given his stress levels and the legality of cannabis in his state. He is currently in the contemplation stage of change.

Client: "Look, I know my partner's worried, and I guess I can see it too when she points it out. I've been using more than I probably should on the weekends, but it's like the only way I can unwind after dealing with a bunch of teenagers all week. I'm not sure what to do though. On one hand, I want to be there for my kids and not be some zonked-out dad. On the other, I need something to help me cope. I mean, I've read studies saying cannabis can be good for stress, right? So, maybe it's not all bad?"

Therapist: "I hear you saying that you're caught between wanting to unwind after a challenging week and the concern your partner has expressed about how your weekend use is affecting both your work and family life. It sounds like you're really aware of the balance you want to strike between managing stress and being fully present for your children. You mentioned reading about the potential benefits of cannabis for stress, and it seems like you're also attuned to the importance of being an engaged parent. It's common to seek ways to relax and cope, especially after dealing with the energy of teenagers all week.

You've also brought up a key point about wanting to be there for your kids without feeling 'zonked-out.' This indicates that you value family presence and engagement over the relaxation cannabis provides. It's quite insightful that you're considering these aspects in relation to your use. Can you tell me more about what changes, if any, you might want

The client, Taylor, is a 29-year-old software developer who has been experiencing increasing difficulty balancing his work and personal life.

Taylor acknowledges that his use has led to some conflicts with his partner, who is concerned about his consumption patterns. His most recent blood work indicated a mild elevation in liver enzymes, which could be related to his cannabis use.

It's also commendable that you're considering the potential effects of your use on your health and your relationship with your partner.

Context: Today's session is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up at a community health clinic. The client, Marcus, is a 42-year-old middle school science teacher who has been experiencing increasing difficulties in his personal life, which he attributes to his marijuana use. He has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates, both for perceived medical reasons (chronic back pain) and for relaxation after work. His partner has expressed concern about his usage patterns, which have escalated from weekend use to nearly daily consumption over the past year. Marcus acknowledges that his use may be affecting his job performance and his interactions with his teenage children. He is currently in the "contemplation" stage of change, recognizing that there might be a problem but not yet fully committed to making a change.

You mentioned that your wife has noticed you seem 'zoned out,' and it's concerning to you that it might be affecting your presence with your children and your focus at school. It takes courage to acknowledge these concerns, especially when they come from a place of love, like your partner's words. Can you tell me more about what aspects of being present for your kids or engaging fully at work are most important to you? And how have you navigated situations where you've felt those values were in conflict with your marijuana use?

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic. The client, Marcus, is a 42-year-old middle school science teacher who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates for perceived stress relief after work. He has been bringing cannabis-infused products to school on multiple occasions, which led to a recent disciplinary warning. His wife has expressed concern about his use, and he acknowledges that his use has been increasing both in frequency and intensity over the past year. Marcus is currently in the contemplation stage of change.

**Client:** "I guess I'm here because my boss caught me with an edible at school, can you believe it? I mean, it's not like I'm an addict or anything. I just use it to unwind after dealing with a bunch of teenagers all day. My wife is all over my case about it now, saying I have a problem. I don't know, maybe I do use it more than I should. But it helps me relax and not go on a rage about the paperwork and grading that piles up. It's just... sometimes I feel like I can't function without it."

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load with your job and the expectations that come with it, especially when it comes to managing the responsibilities and stress that come with being a middle school science teacher. It's understandable how you might feel like turning to cannabis is a way to find some relief after such a demanding day. And it's clear from what you've shared that your wife cares deeply about this issue, which can add another layer of stress and conflict in your relationship.

You mentioned that bringing cannabis-infused products to school led to a disciplinary warning, which suggests that there are important boundaries in your life where the use of cannabis might be coming into conflict. It's also touching on some deeper values you have around being a responsible educator and a dedicated partner.

You've also hinted at a concern about depending on cannabis too much, as you mentioned feeling like you can't function without it sometimes.

Context: This is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic. The client, Taylor, is a 29-year-old graphic designer who has been experiencing increasing difficulty balancing her work and personal life. She initially sought help due to concerns about her daily cannabis use, which she uses both for creative inspiration and as a way to unwind after work. During the initial assessment, it was identified that Taylor's use could be leading to potential substance use disorder, with signs of tolerance and withdrawal.

Client: "I don't know, Dr. Martinez, I guess I just feel stuck. On one hand, I know my daily joints are a problem—my productivity at work has really taken a hit, and I've been missing out on time with my friends because I'm too high. But on the other, without it, I just can't seem to get into that creative flow, and the stress of my job is crushing. It's like this plant is both my muse and my crutch.

Therapist: 🍃 Taylor, it sounds like you're caught in a challenging situation where marijuana has become both a source of inspiration and a crutch that you rely on to manage stress and find your creative flow. You've noticed the impact it's having on your productivity and social life, which shows a keen awareness of how your use is affecting different areas of your life. It's clear that you value your work and personal connections, and it seems like there's a disconnect between these values and your current cannabis use. You've also experienced the difficulties that come with trying to change your routine, like trouble sleeping or feeling anxious when you cut back. These are all important aspects of what you're going through.

Context: This is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic. The client, Marcus, is a 42-year-old middle school science teacher who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates for pain management due to a chronic back condition, but his use has escalated over the past few months, leading to concerns about potential dependence. Marcus acknowledges that his use might be problematic but is hesitant to consider reducing it because he believes it's the only thing helping with his pain. He is in the contemplation stage of change and is accompanied by his partner, who is also concerned about his use.

Therapist: I hear you saying that your chronic back pain has been really intense lately, and it sounds like you've been relying on cannabis to manage that pain. It makes sense that you're looking for relief and that this has become a daily part of your routine. You also mentioned that your partner is concerned about how much you're using and the impact it might be having on your life. It's clear that you care deeply about their concerns and about being present and functional for them as well. You've noticed that when you don't use, it feels like a significant challenge to cope with the pain. It seems like finding a balance that honors both your need for pain management and your desire to be fully engaged with your family is something you're genuinely striving for. Can you tell me more about what those moments without using look like for you, or maybe when you've successfully managed your pain without cannabis in the past?

Context: This is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic. The client, Daniel, is a 42-year-old IT project manager who has been experiencing increased work stress and has turned to cannabis to help him unwind. He has been using marijuana daily, primarily through vaping, for the past five years, initially for medical reasons (chronic back pain). However, his use has escalated, and his partner has expressed concerns about his dependency. Daniel acknowledges that his use is affecting his productivity at work and his relationships but is conflicted about how to change a habit that he feels is the only thing helping him cope. He is currently in the "contemplation" stage of change.

My partner keeps on my case about it, but she doesn't understand how messed up I feel without it at the end of the day. Work's been insane, and it's like the only thing that takes the edge off.

It can be really challenging to find ways to manage stress that don't involve marijuana, especially when it feels like it's the only thing helping you unwind after a long day at work. I hear you saying that you're concerned about how much you're spending and the idea of cutting back is something you've thought about. You also mentioned the tension with your partner and how you wish you could be more present for her without relying on the vape pen. It seems like there's a part of you that wants to make a change, even if it feels hard to put that intention into action right now. Can you tell me more about what values are important to you as a partner and how your use might be affecting those values?

I hear you saying that you've noticed an increase in your use, not just with edibles but also with high-THC concentrates, and you're reflecting on whether this might be more than just a way to relax. It's important to consider how these choices are aligning with the values you hold as a teacher and a partner, and how they fit into the life you want to lead with your family. You mentioned that you've been thinking about how cannabis might be a gateway to other substances, which is an observation worth exploring further. It seems like there's a part of you that's already considering the possibility of change, as you're reflecting on whether your current patterns

Context: This is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic. The client, Marcus, is a 42-year-old middle school science teacher who has been experiencing increased workplace stress and has been using cannabis daily to "relax" after work. He has a stable relationship but admits his use has been a point of contention with his partner, who is concerned about his daily consumption. Marcus has a history of occasional cannabis use that escalated during the pandemic, and he acknowledges it's become more of a problem lately. He is currently in the contemplation stage of change.

Client: "I guess I see both sides now. On one hand, pot really helps me unwind after a long day at school. It's like the only thing that takes the edge off the stress. But my partner keeps bringing up how it's affecting me. They say I'm not as present, you know? And maybe they're right. I've been skipping some of our dates because I just want to get high instead. It's like I can't enjoy anything without it. But then, when I try to cut back, I feel this intense anxiety and restlessness. It's like the cannabis is both my refuge and my prison."

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load with the stress from your job and the concern from your partner about your cannabis use. It's clear that you've noticed the impact it's having on your relationship and how it's affecting your presence in the moments that are important to you. You've also touched on a powerful insight about how cannabis has become both a source of relaxation and a challenge, trapping you between its calming effects and the desire for something more fulfilling without it.

You mentioned that when you try to cut back, you experience anxiety and restlessness. It seems like these feelings might be part of what's keeping you tied to the cannabis use. Have there been any times when you've managed to enjoy your dates or other aspects of your life without turning to cannabis? I'm curious to hear about those experiences, as they might hold some clues for finding new ways to cope with stress that don'

Context: This is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic. The client, Marcus, is a 42-year-old construction worker who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of concentrates and edibles for both pain management due to a recent injury on the job and for relaxation after work. He acknowledges that his use has increased over the past few months, leading to occasional missed days of work and strained relationships with family members who are concerned about his habit. Marcus identifies as being in the contemplation stage of change, recognizing that there may be a problem but not yet fully committed to making a change.

Therapist: "It sounds like you're carrying a significant amount of weight on your shoulders with the pain from your injury and the stress from both your work and family concerns. You've clearly noticed the impact your use has been having, especially in terms of missed days at work and the tension with your sister. It's not uncommon to turn to something that provides relief, like cannabis does for you. You've also expressed a desire to find a balance that addresses both the pain and the stress without it feeling like you're completely reliant on marijuana. That's a really important insight, and it shows a lot of self-awareness and strength.

You mentioned considering cutting back and how that idea is both appealing and daunting at the same time. It's natural to feel this way when facing change, especially when it comes to something that has become an integral part of your daily routine for pain management and relaxation.

Context: This session is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up at a community health clinic. The client, Tyler, is a 29-year-old software developer who has been experiencing increased stress and anxiety at work. He has a stable relationship and lives in an urban apartment. His marijuana use started as a way to unwind after work but has recently escalated to daily use, primarily through vaping concentrates. During the initial assessment, Tyler was identified as being in the Contemplation stage of change, recognizing that his use might be problematic but not yet committed to making a change.

Client: "I guess I'm here because my girlfriend brought it up. She's been on my case about cutting back on this stuff. I mean, I know I've been using it more than I should, especially since I started working from home. It helps me relax after being on the computer all day, but she says it's like I'm just zoning out and not even there with her or our kid. I've thought about it, you know? Maybe I am using a bit too much. But it's hard to let go. It's not like I'm doing anything illegal, and it's not like I'm hurting anyone but myself. Plus, it helps with the edge I feel sometimes. I just don't know if I can deal with that edge without it."

Taylor has been bringing cannabis edibles to social gatherings and often finds himself using more than intended. Recently, his performance at work has been flagged, and his partner has expressed concerns about his frequent absences and changes in behavior.

It seems you're already grappling with the tension between the comfort cannabis provides and the impact it has on your responsibilities and goals. You've noticed this pattern of 'reward and punishment,' and you're questioning whether it's worth it to you. Your desire to enjoy your time off without it potentially leading to disruptions in your professional life shows a lot of self-awareness and concern.

It's not like I have anyone to talk to about it, you know?'
Context: During a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic, the therapist is meeting with Maya, a 29-year-old barista who has been struggling with daily marijuana use. She has come to the clinic after her primary care physician expressed concerns about her frequent absenteeism from work and potential impact on her health. Maya acknowledges that her cannabis use might be a contributing factor but is hesitant to fully commit to change due to its role in managing stress and anxiety.
Client: I know I've been using a lot lately, like, way more than I probably should. It's not like I plan to stop completely; it's my only real break from the coffee shop grind and the constant noise of the city. But my doctor kept harping on how it might be affecting my work, and I missed another shift last week because I 'had to rest.' I guess I can see how it's becoming a problem, but what am I supposed to do when I get home and it's just silent and I feel like I can't breathe? It's not like I have anyone to talk to about it, you know?
Therapist: Maya, it sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden with the pressure from work and the noise of the city. It's understandable that you've been turning to marijuana as a way to find some peace and respite after your long days. You've also noticed how this use might be interfering with your work and responsibilities, which shows a lot of self-awareness and concern. It's clear that you value your role at the coffee shop and being there for your family and friends, and it seems like your marijuana use is at odds with those values sometimes. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you're able to balance your need for relaxation with your other important commitments? And how have you managed to navigate those moments in the past?

You've found marijuana to be a tool for relaxation and pain relief, and it's valid that you're seeking legitimate medical support for these issues.

You mentioned that you're concerned about the possibility of relying too much on cannabis, especially in light of the potential concerns around substance use disorder. It's commendable that you're open to discussing this and looking at ways to manage stress without necessarily turning to marijuana as your first response. You've already taken an important step by bringing this up in our conversation today.

The client, Kai, is a 42-year-old software engineer who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates for relaxation after work. Kai has been experiencing increased stress at his job due to tight deadlines and intense competition in the tech industry.

During the initial assessment, Kai was identified as being in the contemplation stage of change regarding his marijuana use.

Therapist: I hear you saying that your partner's mention of a potential issue with your cannabis use has brought you here today, and it sounds like you're already reflecting on how your use aligns with the life you want to lead, particularly as a parent. You mentioned that you use cannabis to unwind after dealing with work stress, and it seems that this is becoming a more significant part of your routine than you'd like. It's also clear that you care deeply about setting a positive example for your children and not repeating patterns from your own youth that you'd rather they avoid.

You've acknowledged the paradoxical situation where, on one hand, you recognize the potential harm of substance use but also see the complexity of finding healthier ways to manage stress. It's a challenging balance to strike, and it's understandable why this might feel confusing. You've also noted that your recent use has led to missing important commitments

The client, Marcus, is a 42-year-old construction worker who has been using marijuana daily for both pain management due to chronic back pain and recreational use. He acknowledges that his use has increased over the past year, leading to occasional missed work days and strained family relationships. Marcus is currently in the contemplation stage of change, recognizing that his use may be problematic but not yet committed to making a change.

Therapist: It sounds like you're caught between really valuing the relaxation and stress relief that cannabis provides on weekends, and at the same time, you're very aware of the impact it's having on your life, especially with missing important moments with your son. You mentioned that your wife has noticed changes, too, which shows a level of concern for your well-being and your family's. It's clear that you care deeply about your role as a father and a principal, and it seems like there's a part of you that's looking for ways to manage the stress without cannabis, so you can fully engage in those roles and enjoy your time off. Can you tell me more about what those ways might look like or any steps you've already taken towards finding those alternative strategies?

It's understandable how you might be turning to cannabis as a way to find some relief and unwind after a long day. You also mentioned that your girlfriend has noticed your use and her concerns have maybe made you think more about how things are right now. It seems like you're aware that your current pattern of use might not be entirely sustainable, especially if it's leading to tension with someone important in your life. Can you tell me more about what a change might look like for you, or what aspects of your life you hope could improve if you were to adjust your cannabis use?

The client, Tony, is a 42-year-old small business owner who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates for both pain management due to a chronic condition and recreational purposes on weekends. His use has recently escalated, leading to concerns about his health and functioning. During the initial assessment, Tony was identified as being in the "contemplation" stage of change.

Client: Look, I know I've been using more than I probably should, and my wife's been on my case about it. She thinks I'm becoming a pothead, you know?

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, Tina, is a 42-year-old elementary school principal who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates for pain management due to a chronic condition. She has noticed that her use has increased over the past year, and her partner has expressed concerns about her dependency. Tina is currently in the 'contemplation' stage of change, recognizing that her use might be problematic but not yet committing to making a change.

**Client:** I guess I've been thinking a lot about this whole cannabis thing lately. I mean, it helps with my back pain, which is no joke—it's really debilitating at times. But my partner keeps harping on how much I'm using. They say it's becoming a problem, but they don't understand what it's like to live with this constant pain. I've been trying to cut back, really I have, but then the pain hits, and it's just... unbearable. Sometimes I think maybe I am relying on it too much, but other times, I feel like it's the only thing keeping me sane. It's tough because I love my job, and I can't show up high or let it interfere with my responsibilities

Therapist: "It sounds like you're in a tough spot, Marcus, trying to balance managing your chronic pain with the concerns your partner has about your marijuana use. It's clear that finding relief from your back injury is a priority for you, and it's also evident that your use has become more frequent than you or your partner would like. You mentioned waking up and reaching for an edible, which seems to be a pattern that's causing some discomfort, both physically and with how your partner perceives your daily routine. It's understandable that you're looking for ways to manage the pain without feeling like your quality of life is compromised or that you're losing connection with your partner due to the effects of cannabis. You've also brought up a key point about not wanting to feel like a 'zombie' or be in agony, which indicates a desire for a balance that works better for you. It's important to acknowledge

You mentioned feeling like you're always in a haze, which aligns with some concerns your boss picked up on. It's clear that you care deeply about your role as a librarian and the well-being of the children you work with, and it's understandable that you'd want to ensure your use isn't compromising that. You also mentioned that the thought of your parents finding out about your struggles with this is something that worries you, which might be a reflection of your own values around parental expectations or perhaps the kind of example you want to set for the students you serve. It seems like there's a part of you that knows using as much as you have been isn't in line with those values or the professional image you aspire to maintain. Can you

You've even thought about the potential withdrawal symptoms and how intimidating that can feel. It takes courage to acknowledge these complex feelings and the challenges they present. Can you tell me more about what changes you've tried in the past that worked well for you, or what goals you have now that might be impacted by your use?

Context: This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, David, is a 42-year-old middle school science teacher who has been using marijuana primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates on weekends, which he believes helps him cope with stress from his job and personal issues. David acknowledges that his use has increased over the past year, and his partner has expressed concern about his dependency.

Therapist: David, it sounds like you're in a tough spot right now, and it takes a lot of courage to come in and address these concerns with your partner and yourself. You mentioned that your partner has noticed an increase in your use, and how it's started to impact your responsibilities, like picking up your child from school—that's really important, and it seems like a part of you recognizes that too. It's clear that you care deeply about your role as a parent and a teacher, and I can see how that might be at odds with the way marijuana is fitting into your life currently. You've also hinted at the idea of cutting back, which shows there's a part of you that's considering change. Can you tell me more about what your partner's concerns mean to you, and what values as a parent or teacher might guide your next steps?

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, Marcus, is a 42-year-old construction worker who has been experiencing intermittent back pain due to his physically demanding job. He was referred to the clinic by his occupational health provider after tests ruled out any serious underlying conditions for his pain. Marcus has been using cannabis primarily in the evenings to help manage his discomfort, though he also admits to using it on weekends to relax and unwind with friends. His use has increased over the past year, and his partner has expressed concern about his marijuana consumption.

Therapist: "It sounds like you're aware that your partner is concerned about your marijuana use, especially in light of your back pain. You also mentioned that cannabis is one of the few things that seems to help ease your discomfort. It can be really challenging to find ways to manage pain and unwind after a long day at work. I hear you saying that it's become a part of your routine, not just on weekends but also as a way to cope with your back issues. It's important to find balance and strategies that work for you without compromising other aspects of your life that are important to you, like your relationship with your partner. You've been able to succeed in managing your use in the past; could you tell me more about what supported you during those times when you didn't feel the need to use as much? Also, I'm curious, what values or goals might be feeling a bit out of alignment with your current level of cannabis

Therapist: It sounds like you've been grappling with how marijuana fits into your life, especially given its impact on your sleep and work concentration. You mentioned that your wife has noticed your use and is concerned, which suggests that it's not just about unwinding for you—it's also about the role it plays in managing stress and finding enjoyment. It's clear that you care deeply about being a good partner and parent, and I can see how this is something that's important to you. You've also brought up the idea of cutting back, which shows a level of self-reflection and willingness to consider change. Can you tell me more about what a day looks like for you when you decide not to use, and perhaps we can explore together how those days align with the life you want to be living?

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, Taylor, is a 29-year-old barista who has been experiencing intermittent trouble with memory and concentration. These cognitive issues have been gradually increasing, and Taylor recently linked them to their daily marijuana use for both relaxation and creative inspiration. Taylor acknowledges that their use might be problematic but is hesitant to fully commit to change due to fear of losing their social connections tied to cannabis use.

**Client:** I guess I've been thinking a lot about this whole cannabis thing lately. You know, it's like my lifeline some days, especially after work when I feel like I can just unwind and be myself. But then there are times, like this morning when I couldn't remember the names of my regular coffee orders, and it hit me that maybe, just maybe, I've been using too much. My friends, though, they all smoke, and it's kind of our thing. Like, who am I without that shared experience? It's scary to think about. But then again, if I'm losing my edge, or whatever you call it, because of this, isn't it a sign I should cut back? I don't know, Taylor here is confused and doesn't want to lose out on life, but also doesn't want to keep losing pieces

Therapist: It sounds like you're grappling with a real internal conflict, Taylor. It's understandable that you find marijuana to be a source of relaxation and a way to connect with friends, especially after a long day at work. At the same time, it's also clear that you're concerned about how your use might be affecting your memory and concentration, which are incredibly important aspects of your life as a barista and as someone who values being fully present for those around you.

You mentioned this morning's experience with forgetting coffee orders—it seemed to resonate with you as a sign that maybe a change could be beneficial. It's quite insightful of you to notice this and consider it as a potential indicator of your use impacting your daily functioning. You've also touched on the fear of what might be lost if you were to change your routine, including the social connections that are so meaningful to you.

Therapist: 🐛 Teresa, I can see how challenging this must be for you, trying to manage your pain while also being mindful of how your use is affecting other important areas of your life, like work and your relationship with your kids. It sounds like you're really aware of the impact that your edibles use is having, and that's a significant first step in understanding how things might need to change. You mentioned that your friends have noticed you seem to be under the influence often, and it's concerning to you that it's interfering with your ability to perform your job and be present for your children. It seems like you're holding onto a desire to find another way to manage your pain that doesn't overshadow these aspects of your life. Can you tell me more about what values guide you as a parent and a professional, and how your current use aligns or conflicts with those values? 🐛

The client, Taylor, is a 29-year-old barista who has been using marijuana primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates. She reports daily use for about two years, initially for stress relief but now finds it difficult to function without it. Taylor acknowledges that her use has led to some health concerns, including recent anxiety attacks, but she is resistant to the idea that her cannabis use might be a contributing factor.
Client: I don't know, like, maybe my weed is an issue, but it's my only escape from all the stress. I'm always on edge, you know? And when I take a hit or have an edible, it's like I can actually breathe for a minute. But my friends are starting to give me this pity look, like I'm some kind of addict. I don't think that's fair. I mean, it's legal in our state, and I'm not hurting anyone. It's just... maybe I do use it a bit too much, but how am I supposed to relax without it?
Therapist: 🚫 "I can see how much you value your edibles and concentrates as a way to manage stress; it sounds like they've become an important part of your routine. You mentioned feeling judged by your friends, which can be really tough. It's also clear that you're starting to question whether this daily use might be impacting your life in ways you'd like to change."

🚫 "You brought up the concern that your cannabis use might be an issue, and it seems like you're exploring that thought more deeply. It's really important to consider how what we use, especially daily, affects our well-being and our ability to connect with others and enjoy life."

🚫 "You mentioned that using helps you 'breathe for a minute,' which tells me just how much you're looking for relief. It might be helpful to think about other ways you can find that sense of

Context: This is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic. The client, Tony, is a 42-year-old construction worker who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates. He reports daily use for pain management due to an injury on the job but acknowledges that his use has increased over time. Tony's girlfriend has expressed concern about his marijuana use, and he has recently experienced some health issues that may be related. He is in the contemplation stage of change and recognizes that his use might be a problem but is unsure how to address it.

Client: "I guess I've been thinking a lot lately about this whole weed thing. You know, I started using it to help with the pain from my back injury, and it really did wonders at first. But now, I feel like I'm using it more just to get through the day, not just for the pain. My girlfriend keeps on my case about it, saying I'm becoming dependent or something. I don't know if she's right or not, but sometimes, when I try to go without it, I really feel it. Like, my mood just tanks, and everything feels twice as hard.

Therapist: It sounds like you've been carrying a heavy burden with this decision to use cannabis, especially considering your injury and the concerns from your girlfriend. It's clear that you started using it for legitimate pain management, and it's understandable that you might feel dependent on it sometimes, particularly when you notice your mood dipping or when you feel the day is too much without it. It's also insightful of you to recognize this pattern of use that goes beyond just managing pain. You mentioned that when you reflect on your day, you realize you've checked out during those moments with edibles. This awareness is a significant step and shows a great deal of self-reflection.

You've also touched on a key area of concern for many people in your situation—the impact of cannabis on your mood and overall well-being. It's important to consider how using cannabis aligns with the other values you hold, like being present for your girlfriend

Context: This is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic.

He has been experiencing some performance anxiety at his job and has recently mentioned concerns about his memory and concentration. Taylor's use has escalated from weekend use to almost daily use over the past year. He is currently in the contemplation stage, recognizing that his use might be a problem but not yet committing to change.

Client: "I guess I'm here because my girlfriend brought it up. She thinks I'm high all the time, but it's only like, after a long day at work. I know I've been using more than I used to, and maybe it's becoming a bit of an issue, but it really does help me unwind. I just can't seem to find another way to deal with the stress. And honestly, I'm scared that if I cut back, I won't be able to handle my job. But then there's this voice in the back of my head saying maybe I should try and figure out a healthier balance before it's too late, you know? I don't want to lose my girlfriend or my job because of this."

It's really important that you're here exploring this and thinking about what changes might look like for you. You mentioned that your girlfriend brought up your use, and it seems there's a part of you that's already considering finding a balance that might be healthier for you and your relationship. Can you tell me more about the voice in the back of your head that's suggesting you try to figure this out?

You mentioned that your family has expressed concerns about your use of cannabis, and it's clear you've also noticed a pattern that's worrying you. It's really important to find ways to manage stress that don't rely solely on cannabis, even though it might feel like the only option right now. You've recognized that there might be a line between using for relaxation and relying on it too much. That awareness is a big step. Can you tell me more about what your goals are for yourself, both professionally and personally? And how you see cannabis fitting into those goals, or perhaps not fitting in?

The client, Taylor, is a 29-year-old graphic designer who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates for the past three years. Taylor's use has escalated recently, leading to increased financial strain as well as some noticeable health concerns. During the initial assessment, Taylor was identified as being in the "contemplation" stage of change, showing a mix of ambivalence and readiness to address their cannabis use.

Client: Look, I know my buddies and I might be using a bit more than the average person, but can it really be that bad? I don't do it every day, just on the weekends or after a long day at work. It helps me unwind and be creative. But my partner keeps nagging me about cutting back. They say I'm neglecting us because I spend so much on this stuff.

My friends and my girlfriend keep saying something needs to change, but I just can't seem to shake this feeling that I need it to unwind. It's like, after a week of work, I feel like I deserve it, you know? But then I look at my bank account and see how much I'm spending, and it's ridiculous. And my boss mentioned something about my performance... I guess I am starting to see that maybe it's not all just 'chill time.' It's just tough because it's like my routine, my weekend ritual almost.

Therapist: 👂 I hear you saying that your use has been escalating on the weekends and that it's become a significant part of your routine, almost like a ritual. It sounds like this change has caught your attention, especially when you consider the financial impact and how your boss mentioned your performance at work. You're also aware that your girlfriend and friends have noticed this pattern and are concerned about it. It seems like there's a tension between what you've been doing to unwind and the other important aspects of your life, like your finances and professional responsibilities.

🤝 It's understandable that after a week of work, you might be looking forward to some relaxation. It's also clear from what you're sharing that this routine has become more complex for you, especially when considering the feedback from those close to you. You've noticed that your use is affecting areas that are important to you, like your bank account and

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, Carlos, is a 45-year-old construction foreman who has been using marijuana primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates to manage chronic back pain. He has noticed that his use has increased over the past six months, and his partner has expressed concern about his dependency on cannabis. Carlos acknowledges that his use might be a problem but is struggling with the idea of giving up something that he feels genuinely helps him cope with his pain.

**Client:** I know my wife's worried about how much I'm using, and I guess I can see her point sometimes. But you know, this stuff really takes the edge off after a long day on the construction site. My back's killing me, and without it, I don't know if I could handle the pain. It's not like I'm out partying or anything; I'm just trying to get through the day. But maybe I do rely on it too much... I've been thinking about cutting back, but then I worry about the pain coming back full force. It's a tough balance to strike.

**Therapist:** It sounds like you're caught between the immediate relief that cannabis provides and the concerns about your use over time, Carlos. That balance you're talking about is exactly what we can

Therapist: ¡Hola Carlos, it sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden with both your physical pain and the concerns about your marijuana use. I can imagine how challenging it is to find relief while also considering the impact of your use on your life and relationships. It's clear that you're deeply concerned about striking the right balance and finding ways to cope with your back pain without relying too heavily on cannabis. You've mentioned a desire to cut back, which shows a level of self-awareness and willingness to explore change. Can you tell me more about what a successful reduction in use might look like for you and how that aligns with the values that are important to you as a partner, parent, and professional?

You've recognized that there might be problematic aspects to your use, and that's a significant step in its own right.

You mentioned that you don't want to be addicted, which tells me you have some sense of where you'd like to be—a place without the feeling of being dependent on cannabis. It's also important to remember that you've had times when you didn't use, and you managed your pain and workload then. Can you share what helped you get through those periods? It might provide some insight into strategies that could work for you now.

She first sought help at the clinic after her partner expressed concerns about her frequent weekend cannabis use, which has recently escalated to daily use. Mia has been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and uses marijuana for self-medication. She is currently in the Contemplation stage of change, acknowledging that her use might be problematic but not yet committed to making a change.

Client: "I guess I can see why my partner's worried. I mean, I do smoke every day now, and it's probably more than it should be. But honestly, it feels like the only thing that helps with all this stress from work. Deadlines are just insane, and without cannabis, I don't know if I could handle it.

Therapist: ‍Mia, it sounds like you're really grappling with this balance between managing your stress and feeling like cannabis is a necessary part of your routine to unwind. I can understand how challenging it might be to navigate that, especially when you're facing intense deadlines at work. It's also clear from what you've shared that you're aware of the concerns around your daily use and how it might be affecting other areas of your life, like the sense of grogginess you mention waking up with. This awareness is a significant step in its own right.

You've mentioned that you're at home trying to unwind, which tells me that you're looking for ways to cope that don't involve cannabis as well. It's important to recognize those moments when you haven't used and perhaps felt more present or engaged. Can you share some of those experiences with me? I'm curious to hear about what those

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, Sarah, is a 42-year-old elementary school principal who has been experiencing increasing work stress over the past year. She has been using cannabis primarily in edible form to help manage her anxiety. Initially, she was using on weekends, but it has gradually increased to daily use. Sarah's performance at work has recently come into question, and she is beginning to recognize that her cannabis use might be a contributing factor. She is currently in the Contemplation stage of change.

Therapist: It sounds like you've been thoughtfully considering how your cannabis use intersects with the pressures you're facing at work, and the observations from your partner have really captured your attention. You seem to be noticing a potential link between your use and how you're managing professionally, which is quite insightful. It's clear that maintaining your position as an elementary school principal is important to you, and it's understandable why you'd want to explore if changes in your cannabis use could support that. You've also mentioned the importance of being there for your partner and how their observations have resonated with you. It's a delicate balance, finding ways to relax and cope while also ensuring that your responsibilities at work and home are met effectively. What are your thoughts on how you might start to explore what changes, if any, could align more closely with the values and goals you hold for yourself as a professional and as a partner?

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, Tony, is a 45-year-old construction worker who has been experiencing intermittent back pain due to his physically demanding job. He was referred to the clinic by his occupational health provider after testing positive for THC during a routine drug screening. Tony uses cannabis primarily in the evenings to help manage his chronic pain and has been doing so for over a decade, both medically and recreationally. He acknowledges that his use has increased recently and is concerned about the potential impact on his health and job.

The client, Taylor, is a 29-year-old graphic designer who has been experiencing increasing stress and anxiety in her work life. She has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates for both medical reasons (chronic pain from an old sports injury) and recreational use. Her use has escalated over the past six months, with frequent daily consumption on weekends, which has led to conflicts with her partner who is concerned about her dependency.

Client: "I don't know, Dr. Patel. It feels like I'm stuck in this cycle where I use cannabis to cope with stress and then I end up feeling more anxious about it. My partner keeps bringing it up, saying I'm addicted, but I don't think it's that bad. I mean, I use it for my pain, right? But when I look back at the weekend, it's like I can't remember parts of it because I was so high. That's not who I want to be. And yet, here I am, planning my next dose.

It sounds like you're deeply aware of the impact your cannabis use has on your memory and how that conflicts with the person you aspire to be. You've also mentioned the concern about your partner noticing a change in your behavior, which is an important aspect of your relationship. It seems there's a part of you that values your well-being and another part that's looking for an escape. It's common to seek relief from difficult emotions, but it's also commendable that you recognize this pattern and are expressing a desire to explore different ways of coping. Can you tell me more about the goals or values that might be affected by your current use?

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic. The client, Brian, is a 45-year-old construction manager who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates for pain management due to an injury sustained on the job. He has a stable marriage and two teenage children. His use has escalated over the past year, and his performance at work has declined. Brian acknowledges that his marijuana use may be affecting his life but is uncertain about how to change his habits without losing the pain relief he relies on.

I can't focus on the construction plans, can't sleep through the night without something to knock me out. It's not like I'm out there getting high for kicks; it's more like I can't function without it. I guess I am using it a lot, more than I intended when I first started. But isn't it better to have a plant help with the pain than popping pills all day?

You've brought up some important points, like the increase in your use lately and the impact it might be having on your life.

Context: This is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic. The client, Taylor, is a 29-year-old graphic designer who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates for recreational purposes. Taylor has been experiencing increased anxiety and has acknowledged that his marijuana use might be affecting his mental health. He has been categorized as being in the "contemplation" stage of change, as he recognizes there might be a problem but is not yet committed to making a change.

Client: Look, I know you're gonna ask me about my weed use again, and I get it, it's probably a big deal, especially with how I've been feeling lately. But man, cannabis has been such a part of my life, you know? It helps me unwind after work, and honestly, it's the only thing that seems to take the edge off when I'm stressed out. On one hand, I've been thinking it might be affecting my anxiety more than helping it, but on the other, I can't remember the last time I felt that relaxed without it. It's like this catch-22, you know? I want to feel normal without it, but when I try to cut back, I just feel off and restless.

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a significant burden with this catch-22 you're describing, where cannabis has been both a source of relaxation and a potential contributor to your anxiety. It's really insightful that you've noticed the paradox you're experiencing, especially when it comes to feeling 'off' or restless when trying to cut back. You're clearly someone who values finding ways to relax after a long day at work, and it's understandable that you're looking for alternatives that align with your goal of managing your anxiety more effectively. It seems like there's a part of you that's already considering how you might navigate this challenge differently. Can you tell me more about what a 'normal' feeling without cannabis looks like for you, and perhaps we can explore some of the strengths you've used in the past to handle stress without it?

Context: This is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic. The client, Taylor, is a 42-year-old high school principal who has been experiencing increased work stress and has turned to marijuana for relaxation on a near-daily basis. He acknowledges that his use has escalated over the past year but is hesitant to consider it a problem. Taylor's performance at work has not yet been affected, but he admits his use interferes with family time and his commitment to a healthy lifestyle.

Client: Look, I know I've been using pretty consistently lately, and my wife's been on my case about cutting back. She says it's becoming a problem, but I just don't feel like I have the same kind of issue that, you know, like with hard drugs or anything. I use it to unwind after a long day at school, and it helps me relax. But she's right, sometimes I miss out on family time because I'm too zoned out. It's just... I don't know if it's fair to say I have a disorder when it feels like it's doing more good than harm some days.

Therapist: Taylor, it's really important that we explore your feelings and experiences with marijuana use in this space. You mentioned that you feel it's helping you unwind

You've noticed that sometimes the relaxation you get from using can come at a cost, especially when it comes to missing out on family moments. It's clear that you value your role as a principal and as a partner and parent, and I imagine that feeling 'zoned out' isn't quite aligning with those values. You've also acknowledged that while marijuana may offer some benefits, there are times when it might not be the best choice for you.

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, Mia, is a 29-year-old elementary school teacher who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates for perceived stress relief after work. She has come to recognize that her use has escalated over the past year, and she's concerned about the impact it might be having on her health and her ability to maintain a healthy relationship with her partner.

Therapist: It sounds like you've been grappling with a bit of tension between what others are saying about your cannabis use and how you're feeling about it yourself. It's clear that you care deeply about your role as an educator and the well-being of your students, as well as maintaining a healthy relationship with your partner. You've noticed that your use of cannabis might be affecting these important aspects of your life, particularly how you connect with your partner when you're high. It seems like part of you finds it to be a necessary way to decompress after the demands of your job, while another part is concerned about the distance it might be creating between you and your partner. You're at a point where you're considering if this is something you want to continue integrating into your life, especially given the potential impact on your relationships. It's also commendable that you're here seeking understanding and exploring options. Can you tell me more

Context: This is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic. The client, Tyler, is a 29-year-old software developer who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates for recreational purposes. He has recently experienced a series of work-related setbacks, which have exacerbated his daily marijuana use as a coping mechanism. Tyler acknowledges that his use may be problematic but is conflicted about making changes due to its perceived benefits for stress relief. He is currently in the contemplation stage of change.

She says it's a problem, but honestly, I don't know where I'd be without it some days. My job is crazy stressful, and it helps me unwind. But then, after I eat an edible or dab, I just end up on the couch for hours, feeling kinda numb and like I've wasted the day.

Therapist: It sounds like you're in a tough spot right now, trying to balance the relief that cannabis brings with the sense of having lost time that leaves you feeling numb and unproductive. It's clear that your girlfriend's concerns have prompted you to seek this session, and it shows a level of self-awareness to be considering this issue deeply. You've noticed this cycle where the cannabis use is both a source of comfort and a barrier to your goals. It's understandable how something that initially helps can then feel like it's getting in the way of what you value, like your work and the time with your girlfriend. Can you tell me more about the values that are most important to you as a partner and a professional, and how cannabis use might be aligning or conflicting with those?

You mentioned that your sister and your boss have noticed changes in your level of presence and attentiveness, which can be concerning. It seems like you're looking for a way to manage your pain without it affecting other responsibilities that are really important to you. You also shared how difficult it can feel when the demands of the day pile up and you turn to your vape pen as a form of 'me time.' It makes sense that you'd want to find a balance that allows you to care for yourself while also fulfilling your commitments. Can you tell me more about what your ideal balance might look like and how you've managed to approach it in the past?

You're also aware of the concern that your use might be impacting your role as a parent, which is really important to you. That moment with your child's drawing was quite powerful and brought up some significant worries about how your use might affect your relationship with them. It seems like you have a deep desire to be fully present for your kids and to manage both your work and home responsibilities without the aid of cannabis. Can you tell me more about what steps you've taken in the past when you felt the urge to use but chose not to? I'm really interested in hearing about how you've managed to navigate those moments, as it sounds like you have some strategies that might be helpful to revisit.

Without it, I can barely move. I've been trying to cut back, but then the pain hits, and I'm reaching for another edible or dabbing. My partner's worried about the money we're spending on this, and I am too, but it's like I can't help it. I don't want to lose her, and I know I need to do something about
Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a significant burden with your pain management and the impact it's having on your life, including your relationship with your partner and finances. You've recognized that there's an increase in your use of cannabis and that it's become a frequent part of your day. It's clear that you value your relationship and don't want to lose your partner, which seems to be at odds with how marijuana use is affecting your life right now. You've also mentioned trying to cut back but finding the pain makes it challenging to stick to those intentions. It's really tough to navigate this situation where something that helps with the pain also creates conflict and concern about its cost and impact on your life. Can you tell me more about what changes, if any, you've successfully managed in the past without the use of cannabis, especially during times when pain has been a significant issue?

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, Ryan, is a 45-year-old construction worker who has been using marijuana daily for both pain management due to a chronic back injury and recreational purposes. He acknowledges that his use has increased over the past year, and his partner has expressed concerns about his dependency. Ryan is in the contemplation stage of change, recognizing that his use might be a problem but also feeling confused about how to reconcile its benefits with its potential negative impacts on his life.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really caught between the pain relief that marijuana provides and the sense of being fully present for your kids, which is a deep concern for you. You've been using it for years and it's become part of who you are, but you're also noticing that it can take you away from those important moments with your children. That tension between managing your pain and being there for them seems to be at the heart of what you're contemplating right now. You've already taken a significant step by bringing this up and acknowledging that there might be a problem. Can you tell me more about how you've handled times in the past when you wanted to be there but chose not to use marijuana?

Context: This is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic. The client, Maria, is a 42-year-old elementary school principal who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles on a daily basis for stress management and to alleviate chronic pain from an old injury. She acknowledges that her use has increased over the past few months, and her partner has expressed concerns about her reliance on cannabis. Maria is identified as being in the "contemplation" stage of change, as she recognizes there might be a problem but is not yet committed to making a change.

You also recognize the importance of managing both your stress and the chronic pain from your injury. It's clear that you've been thoughtful about how cannabis edibles have played a part in helping you navigate these pressures. You mentioned that your partner has noticed an increase in your use, and it seems like this has prompted some reflection on your part. You're concerned about the possibility of becoming reliant on cannabis and the potential impact this could have on your life, especially given your important role with the children and parents you serve.

It's clear that you value your job and relationship deeply, and you're concerned about how your use might be affecting them. You've also mentioned times when you've been able to manage without cannabis, which shows there's a part of you that's already found some strategies that work for you.

It helps me get into that zone, you know? But sometimes, I wake up and feel like I've slept through half a day. And my friends have noticed, too. They say I'm getting spacey. I don't know, Theresa. I love how it frees up my mind, but I also get really anxious about whether I'm doing this too much. It's like, I want to be creative without feeling like I'm lost in a haze all the time.
Therapist: It sounds like you're really attuned to both the positive aspects of how marijuana helps you tap into your creativity and the concerns about how it might be impacting your daily life and well-being. You've noticed that it can lead to a full day feeling wasted, and your friends have picked up on changes in your alertness. It's clear that you value your creative process as well as being fully present with those around you, especially as a parent. It seems there's a tension between wanting to maintain that creative flow and the desire to feel more grounded and present. Can you tell me more about what it is about this balance that feels important for you right now?

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, Tony, is a 30-year-old software developer who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates for relaxation after work. He has recently admitted to himself and his girlfriend that his use might be a problem, placing him in the Contemplation stage of change.

**Client:** I mean, I know I've been using a lot lately, like, way more than I used to. My girlfriend brought it up, you know? She's worried about me. But here's the thing, doc—on one hand, I feel like I need that escape at the end of the day. Work is insane, and it just helps me unwind. On the other hand, I've been forgetting things, missing appointments, and I even slept through my alarm on a workday because I 'forgot' I had set it. That's not cool. But I don't know, sometimes I feel like without it, I can't handle the stress. It's like this vicious cycle where I use it to cope, and then I have more to cope with because of using it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a significant amount of stress from your work, and you've noticed that cannabis has become a more frequent part of your routine for coping with that stress. You mentioned the concern your girlfriend has brought up, about both your use and how it might be affecting your daily life—like missing appointments and oversleeping. It seems like you're aware that these are signs that your use might be having an impact on your well-being and daily responsibilities. You also touched on a difficult cycle where the use of cannabis to cope is leading to more stress and a need for even more coping. It's clear that you value your relationship with your girlfriend and your professional role, and it seems these values are in tension with your current cannabis use. Can you tell me more about what changes you might be hoping for or what steps you think could help you manage the stress from work without relying on cannabis as much?

You've even tried to cut back before and found it challenging, which is not uncommon. It's understandable that this internal conflict feels intense. It's a sign that what you're experiencing matters to you deeply. You mentioned that you have a desire to be healthy, and you're concerned about how your use aligns with that goal. Can you tell me more about what health means to you, and perhaps we can explore together how your values as a graphic designer, parent, and partner might guide your next steps?

It sounds like you're aware that there's been an increase in your cannabis use, particularly on weekends, and that it's begun to influence your social activities. You mentioned that sometimes the planning around your use takes precedence over spending time with friends, which seems to align with some concerns you have about missing out on those experiences. Can you tell me more about how you feel when these conflicts arise?

Therapist: "It sounds like you're at a bit of a crossroads with how you're feeling about your marijuana use, especially as it relates to unwinding after work and the impact it has on your evenings. You mentioned that sometimes the high is so intense it interferes with enjoying activities you look forward to, which seems to hint at some concerns you have. It's also clear that you care about how others perceive you, as your coworker's comment prompted you to seek help. You bring up an important point about legality, and I understand that it's not about breaking the law, but rather about how this substance fits into your life and whether it's aligning with what you value. You've also acknowledged that it might be taking over your evenings, which suggests you're aware of a potential change you'd like to see. Can you tell me more about what you hope for in your evenings without the

Context: This session is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up at a community health clinic. The client, David, is a 29-year-old software engineer who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates on a daily basis. He has come to recognize that his use may be impacting his work performance and social life but still struggles with the idea of giving up something that he feels helps him cope with high stress levels at work. David is currently in the contemplation stage of change, recognizing that there are problems related to his marijuana use but not yet committed to making a change.

Client: Look, I know you're trying to help me figure this out, and I appreciate that. It's just... cannabis kind of feels like my only relief from the crazy pressure at work. I mean, I don't go to work high, but after a long day, it's like the only thing that takes the edge off. My friends use it too, so it's not like it's this isolated problem. But I guess I can see how maybe I'm relying on it a bit too much. It's complicated, you know? On one hand, it helps me unwind and keeps me from getting totally fried. On the other hand, I've missed a couple of deadlines because... well, let's just say my "relief"

Therapist: David, it sounds like you're carrying a significant amount of weight with the pressure at work, and it's understandable that you're looking for ways to manage that stress. You've noticed how cannabis can help take the edge off, and I can see how important it is for you to have that as part of your routine, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed. It's also clear that you care deeply about your performance at work and not wanting marijuana use to interfere with meeting your deadlines. You've even thought about the impact your use might be having on your social life and family life, which shows a great deal of self-awareness and concern.

You mentioned that you've missed a couple of deadlines, and it seems like there might be a connection between those instances and your cannabis use. Can you tell me more about what that has been like for you when these things happen? How does it feel when your work

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, Devon, is a 29-year-old software developer who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates. He uses almost daily, citing stress relief and insomnia management as his main reasons. Devon acknowledges that his use has increased over the past year but denies that it has become a problem. He is brought to this session by his partner, who is concerned about his frequent absences from work and social activities due to his cannabis use.

**Client:** I know my partner's worried, and I guess coming here is kind of her idea. I mean, I don't have a problem, right? I use because it helps me unwind after a long day of coding. It's not like I'm doing anything illegal or harmful. But I'll admit, sometimes I wake up in the afternoon and realize I've spent the whole morning eating edibles and not getting anything done. It's like I'm stuck in this loop where I need it to get through the day, and that's gotta be a bit off, isn't it? But at the same time, what am I supposed to do without it? My sleep is a mess, and work is stressful as hell without some kind of relief.

You've noticed moments where your use feels like more than just a way to relax or manage insomnia, and you're questioning if this pattern might not be the healthiest approach in the long run. It's understandable that you're looking for ways to cope with stress and get a good night's sleep without relying on cannabis. You've also mentioned a desire to break free from feeling stuck in this loop, which shows a level of self-awareness and concern. Can you tell me more about what changes you might be open to exploring that could help support your goals and values as a software developer, partner, and parent?

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, David, is a 38-year-old software developer who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates on a near-daily basis for relaxation after work.

David is currently in the contemplation stage of change.

It sounds like your girlfriend's concerns have prompted you to consider the role that cannabis plays in your life, and it's clear that you're already thinking about the balance between unwinding after work and ensuring that you're at your best both professionally and personally. You've noticed that your use might be getting ahead of you, especially when it comes to finances, and you're feeling a bit uncertain about how to proceed. It's understandable that the idea of changing your routine, which you've relied on for relaxation, could bring up some anxiety.

It's really insightful that you've noticed the conflict between wanting to relax and unwind with cannabis and the sense that it might be taking over more of your time than you'd like. You mentioned that on Sunday mornings, the thoughts about cannabis are persistent, which suggests it's quite a presence in your life. It's also clear that you care deeply about this, as you're here seeking clarity and perhaps looking for ways to align your use with your other values and goals. Can you tell me more about what those values and goals are for you, and how they might be influencing the way you think about your cannabis use right now?

You've noticed the impact it's had, like the client meeting you missed, which reflects a concern for how things might be different if you were not under the influence.

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, David, is a 30-year-old software developer who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates. He has come to the clinic at the suggestion of his girlfriend, who is concerned about his recent increase in use, especially on weekends. David acknowledges that his use might be problematic but feels conflicted about changing a habit that helps him relax and unwind after a stressful week of work. He is considered to be in the contemplation stage of change.

**Client:** I know my girlfriend's worried about how much I've been using lately, and I guess I can see her point when she brings it up. It's not like I'm high all day, you know? I only use on weekends, but sometimes it feels like those days just blur together. I do feel like it helps me recharge, especially after dealing with code bugs all week. But she mentions how I space out, how I'm not 'really there' sometimes, and I guess that's a problem. I don't want to lose her over this, but at the same time, it's like my only escape from the pressure. What do you think I should do?

It's clear that you value your relationship with her and that you're aware of the role cannabis plays in both helping you recharge and potentially affecting how present you are. You've also touched on the conflict between finding an escape from work stress and not wanting to lose what you have with her because of this habit. It's a delicate balance, and it's understandable that you're reflecting on how you can reconcile these aspects of your life.

Context: This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, David, is a 38-year-old software engineer who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles on weekends to unwind from work stress. He acknowledges that his use has escalated over the past year, and his girlfriend has expressed concerns about his increasing reliance on cannabis. David falls into the "contemplation" stage of change, as he recognizes there might be a problem but is not yet fully committed to making a change.
Client: I guess I should probably talk about this weed thing, huh? I mean, it's not like I'm doing it every day or anything. It's just the weekends, right?

Therapist: It sounds like you're aware that your use has been increasing, and you've noticed both the relaxation it brings and also the impact it can have on how you start your day. You mentioned that your girlfriend has pointed out this change, and it seems like you believe her observation is accurate. It's not uncommon for people to find that their approach to unwinding can sometimes lead to wanting more than they intended, especially after a busy week. You clearly care about making the most of your time together and finding ways to relax that align with your values as a partner and as someone who enjoys his work. It's also important to consider how these choices might be affecting your goals as a parent or in other areas of your life. Can you tell me more about what aspects of your life are most important to you right now, and how marijuana use fits into that picture?

Context: This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, David, is a 39-year-old middle school science teacher who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles on weekends to unwind after a stressful week of teaching and grading. He has no legal troubles or significant health concerns but has expressed concern about his recent increase in use during a previous MI session. David's use patterns have shifted from occasional to more frequent over the past year, and his partner has recently brought up their worry about his cannabis consumption.

Client: "I don't know, Therapist. It's like, every Friday after work, I just feel this overwhelming need to relax, you know? The edibles help me chill out, and it's not like I'm high all day or anything. It's just the evenings. But my partner's been on my case lately, saying I'm using too much. They think I'm becoming dependent or something. I can stop anytime I want to, but then again, the thought of getting through those long weekends without that break... it's scary. I guess I am starting to notice that I plan my weekend around when I'll have my next edible. Maybe I should rethink this, but it's hard. It's not like I'm doing anything harmful, right

Therapist: "It sounds like you're really aware of the role that cannabis plays in helping you unwind after a busy week, and it's clear that this has become an important part of your routine. You mentioned that your partner has brought up their concerns about your use, which indicates that what you're experiencing isn't just your own thoughts but something that's also on their radar. It's understandable that the idea of getting through those weekends without cannabis could feel daunting and even a bit scary. You've also noticed that your weekend plans seem to revolve around when you'll have your next edible, which suggests there's a connection between your use and how you're managing your time.

You've expressed a desire to rethink your use and acknowledged that there might be some changes you'd like to consider. This shows a level of self-reflection and openness to change that is a crucial first step.

The client, David, is a 29-year-old software developer who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles and concentrates on a nearly daily basis for the past two years. He initially started using cannabis to help manage anxiety but has noticed that his use has increased significantly, especially since the start of the pandemic. David acknowledges that his use is affecting his productivity at work and his relationships with friends and family but has been resistant to the idea that he might have a marijuana use disorder.

Client: "I guess I do see how my weed habit has kinda taken over my life, you know? Like, I'm always planning my day around when I can take a break to eat an edible or hit my vape pen.

The client, Teresa, is a 45-year-old elementary school principal who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles on a daily basis for the past year. She initially started using it to manage stress and anxiety but has noticed her use increasing and her ability to cope without it decreasing.

You've noticed that when you try to cut back, the pain comes back strongly, which can be really unsettling and make finding that balance feel even more challenging. It's clear that you care deeply about managing your pain effectively and that you're also looking for a way to address this issue in a healthier way. Your partner's concerns are also an important part of the picture, as they reflect a desire for change that might be shared between both of you. It takes courage to come in and explore these feelings and consider different approaches. You've already started to think about this issue in terms of finding a solution, which is a step toward change.

Therapist: It sounds like you're grappling with a significant concern between managing your stress and maintaining your health, especially given the feedback from your recent health check. It's understandable that you're looking for ways to unwind after such a demanding day, and it seems that marijuana has become a key part of finding that balance. You also mentioned the importance of upholding your image as a school principal and the role model you want to be for the children and community you serve. It's clear that you value both your well-being and your professional reputation, and there might be some tension between these priorities. You've noticed how your use aligns with your need for relaxation and social connection but also how it could potentially impact your health and the image you wish to maintain. Can you tell me more about a time when you felt successful in balancing these aspects of your life without relying on marijuana?

It's clear that you care deeply about both your career and your family, and it seems like your marijuana use is at odds with these important aspects of your life. You've already taken an important step by recognizing the impact of your use on these areas and expressing a desire to make changes.

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, Isabella, is a 42-year-old elementary school principal who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles on weekends to unwind from work stress. She has no significant medical conditions but reports occasional health concerns that she attributes to her marijuana use. Isabella's use has escalated over the past year, and her partner has expressed concern about her consumption. Isabella is currently in the contemplation stage of change, acknowledging that her use might be a problem but also feeling conflicted about changing a habit that provides her with relaxation and relief from stress.

You mentioned feeling stuck in this cycle, which indicates a desire for change might already be there. It can be challenging to find alternative ways to unwind from the pressures at school without relying on edibles. Have you noticed any moments when you've felt more at peace or productive without them? I'm curious to hear about those times, if there are any, as they could offer some insights into what might work for you now.

And regarding your concerns about feeling zoned out after using, it seems like those feelings might be a signal of how the edibles are affecting you. It's important to listen to your body and consider what it needs, especially when it comes to balancing relaxation with being effective in your role as an elementary

Context: This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, Taylor, is a 29-year-old graphic designer who has been experiencing increasing difficulties in her personal relationships due to her marijuana use. She has been using cannabis primarily in the evenings and on weekends, both for its relaxing effects and to help manage anxiety. However, her partner has recently expressed concern about her consumption levels, which has led to increased tension in their relationship. Taylor acknowledges that her use has escalated over the past year but is hesitant to change a routine that she feels is one of the few coping mechanisms she has. She is currently in the contemplation stage of change, recognizing that there are problems related to her use but not yet committed to taking action.

Client: "I don't know, sometimes I feel like I can't even after a long day without it. Like, it's my time to unwind and just be. But my partner keeps bringing it up, saying I'm 'lost' in it, you know? I guess I see what they're saying sometimes, especially when I look at how much I've gone through in a week. It's not like the old days, right? I'm not an every-day user or anything. But then again, maybe I am using it to avoid dealing with some stuff. I don't know

Therapist: "It sounds like you're grappling with some complex feelings about how marijuana fits into your life, especially in light of your partner's concerns and the tension that's arisen because of it. You've noticed a pattern in your use that's made you question whether it's as under control as you'd like it to be. It's really important to recognize that you're not alone in this—many people find themselves in similar situations, looking for ways to unwind after a long day.

You've also mentioned that you've had moments where you've managed without cannabis and those times might hold some valuable insights into what could be possible moving forward. It's clear that you care deeply about your relationship and the way your use is impacting it. You're at a point where you can see both sides—the need for relaxation and the desire to be fully present with your partner, especially given the 'stuff

Context: The setting is a follow-up session at a community health clinic. The client, Samantha, is a 42-year-old school librarian who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles for both stress relief and sleep aid since her divorce a year ago. She acknowledges that her use has increased over the past few months, leading to occasional missed work due to hangover effects. Samantha is currently in the "contemplation" stage of change, as she recognizes there may be a problem but hasn't fully committed to making a change.

Client: I guess I'm here because my sister mentioned something about 'cannabis counseling.' I mean, I know I've been eating more of those gummy things than I used to, especially on the weekends. My partner said it was getting out of hand, and I missed a couple of days at work because I just couldn't get up. But honestly, it helps me sleep, and after everything with us, I need something to unwind. I don't know if it's a problem or if I'm just using it to cope. It's not like I'm doing it all the time. Right?

Therapist: I can understand how challenging it must be to find ways to unwind after everything you've been through, and it sounds like you're really trying to cope with those feelings. You mentioned that you've missed some work due to the effects of using the gummies, which tells me you're acutely aware of how your use is impacting your life, especially in terms of your responsibilities as a school librarian. It's also clear that you value your role and the importance of being present for your students. You've brought up some important points about how using helps you sleep, but at the same time, it's also affecting your ability to get up and be there for work. It seems like there's a part of you that's looking for ways to manage stress and sleep without cannabis playing such a central role. Can you tell me more about what your ideal approach to coping might look like?

Context: This is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up session at a community health clinic. The client, Brian, is a 42-year-old middle school science teacher who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles on weekends due to stress from his job and personal issues with his partner. Brian has recognized that his use has increased over the past few months, and his performance at work has suffered slightly, leading him to seek help. He identifies as a daily user for relaxation and pain management, although he does not have a prescription. Brian is currently in the contemplation stage, acknowledging that his use might be a problem but is not yet ready to commit to change.

You mentioned how your weekend use has started to interfere with your work responsibilities, and I can see how that might be concerning for you and your partner. It's clear that cannabis plays a role in helping you unwind, especially with the pain from your injury. It's also impressive to hear about your dedication to your students and your commitment as a partner. You're aware that your current use pattern might not be fully aligned with these important roles in your life. It's a delicate balance, trying to find relief and relaxation without it impacting other areas that are also very important to you.

Context: This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, Samantha, is a 42-year-old elementary school principal who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles on a daily basis for stress management and for enjoyment after work. She has recently expressed concerns to her partner about her use patterns but has not taken any steps to reduce her consumption. Samantha is at the contemplation stage of change, recognizing that her use might be a problem but not yet committed to making a change.

Client: Look, I know I've been using edibles pretty much every day after work. I tell myself it helps me unwind and deal with the stress from the school. But my partner keeps saying I'm becoming more forgetful, and sometimes I just zone out and can't get anything done.

It's clear that you value your role as an elementary school principal and the downtime you enjoy after work, but it seems like this routine has become something that's hard to step away from even when it might not be serving you as well as it used to.

It's clear that you care deeply about being fully present for your students, and it seems that your use sometimes interferes with that important aspect of your life. You've also recognized that there are times when your pain is more manageable after using, which tells me how much you value finding ways to cope effectively. It's not uncommon to feel caught between wanting to ease the discomfort and recognizing the importance of being available for those who depend on us. Reflecting on your role as a teacher and a partner, what are some of the values that might be at odds with your current use? And how have you navigated these conflicting priorities in the past?

Taylor's use has escalated from weekly to daily over the last year, and their partner has expressed concern about Taylor's increasing preoccupation with cannabis.

Therapist: It sounds like you're in a tough spot right now, caught between the desire to unwind and enjoy time with friends and the concerns your partner has raised about your use of cannabis. You've noticed the impact it's having on your work performance and your shared home life, which shows a lot of self-awareness. It's clear that you care deeply about your relationship and your role within it, as well as your professional responsibilities. You've also recognized the importance of being present for your partner and for yourself. It can be really challenging to find alternative ways to manage stress and connect with others when cannabis has become such a regular part of your routine. Can you tell me more about what aspects of your life, beyond this concern, are most important to you right now, and how your use aligns or perhaps conflicts with those priorities?

It's like my body expects it now. And I do get a lot of relief from it. But then there are those mornings after, when I wake up and think, 'What if this is affecting my health? What if I can't handle stress without it?' It's like this seesaw, back and forth. One day I'm ready to cut back
Therapist: It sounds like you're in a challenging place right now, balancing the desire for stress relief with concerns about your use and its impact on your health and work. You mentioned that sometimes after using, you wake up and question if it's the best choice for you, which is a powerful observation. It's clear that you care deeply about your role as an elementary school principal and the well-being of the children you serve. This concern seems to be at odds with how you're currently managing stress. You also mentioned a moment of readiness to cut back, which is a hopeful sign. Can you tell me more about what might support you in taking steps towards those moments when you feel ready to change your habits?

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, Danielle, is a 42-year-old elementary school principal who has been experiencing increased job stress and has turned to marijuana to "relax" most evenings after work. She acknowledges that her use has been more frequent over the past six months but denies that it's become a problem.

**Client:** I guess I'm here because my partner mentioned that I might have a problem, but I don't know. I mean, I'm not selling drugs or anything extreme like that. I just like to unwind with a joint after a long day at school. It helps me relax and not take my stress out on the kids or my family. But I do see where you're coming from. Sometimes, I might skip a meeting or two because I'm too high, and then I feel guilty about it. It's like I can't win. If I don't smoke, I'm tense and snappy, but if I do, I feel like I'm neglecting my responsibilities.

**Therapist:** Danielle, it sounds like you're caught between wanting to manage your stress in a way that doesn't interfere with your important roles, and the desire to find relief through marijuana use. You've noticed the impact

You mentioned that you feel guilty when you skip meetings because of your use, and it seems like you're noticing the impact it has on your ability to be present for the children at school and for your family. That's a very important observation, as it highlights how your use is intertwined with your values as an educator and a partner. You also brought up a key point about feeling tense and snappy when you don't use—it seems like marijuana is playing a role in managing those feelings. It's quite insightful that you're recognizing this as a dilemma, where finding a way to relax doesn't seem to be without consequences. You've also touched on the idea of neglecting responsibilities when you do use. It's clear that you care deeply about your role and how

Context: During a follow-up motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic, the therapist meets with Samantha, a 42-year-old elementary school principal who has been grappling with her marijuana use for several months. Samantha initially sought help due to concerns from her superiors about her performance at work, which she attributed to her increased cannabis use on weekends. She identifies as using cannabis for both medical reasons (chronic back pain) and recreational purposes.

Client: "I don't know, Dr. Rodriguez. I mean, I really believe that pot helps me manage my back pain, you know? It's like the only thing that actually takes the edge off after a long week at school. But then, on Sundays, when I'm high half the day... I look at the clock and realize it's 8 PM, and I haven't graded one paper or planned for Monday. It's like I'm wasting my life away. My partner has been on my case about it, too. They say I'm becoming more forgetful, and I've missed a couple of important events for the kids at school because I 'spaced out.' I guess I can see how it might be a problem, but it's so hard to quit when I rely on it for my pain."

Therapist: 👩‍⚕️ Dr. Rodriguez: I can really see how important managing your back pain is for you, and it sounds like cannabis has been a significant part of that management. It's also clear that the relaxation and relief it provides are something you value deeply after a demanding week at school. You've also brought up some very poignant concerns about the impact of your use on your personal responsibilities and relationships, especially with your partner noticing changes in your memory and attendance for important events. It seems like there's a tension between what you're experiencing as relief and the aspects of your life that are feeling neglected because of your use. Can you tell me more about how these conflicting parts are affecting your sense of who you are, especially as a principal and someone who cares deeply for her students and family?

You've even noticed how your use on weekends has started to overshadow other activities you enjoy. That self-awareness is a significant step. It's not uncommon for people to start questioning if their use is aligning with the life they want, especially when it impacts relationships and personal goals. You mentioned that you've thought about the possibility of making some changes, which shows a lot of courage. Can you tell me more about what a balanced approach might look like for you, one that honors both your need for pain management and your desire for a stronger relationship with your partner?

The client, Samantha, is a 42-year-old elementary school principal who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles for both relaxation and sleep aid. She has noticed her use pattern increasing over the past few months, especially on weekends when she feels overwhelmed by work stress. Her partner has expressed concerns about her consumption, which has prompted her to seek help. Samantha is currently in the contemplation stage of change, acknowledging that her use might be a problem but also feeling conflicted about giving up something that provides her with relief.

**Client:** I guess I'm here because my partner basically forced me to come. I know I've been using more than I probably should, and I've seen the ads about getting help for cannabis use, so I thought, okay, I'll give it a shot. But, you know, it helps me sleep, and after a long week at school, it's like my little escape. It's not like I'm doing hard drugs or anything. Sometimes, I think I'd rather feel the stress than be numb all the time, but then other times, I just can't face another sleepless night without it. I'm not sure what to do anymore.

She has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles on a daily basis to help manage her anxiety.

The client, Miguel, is a 42-year-old middle school science teacher who has been experiencing increasing difficulties in his relationship due to his marijuana use, particularly with concentrates. He has been using cannabis daily for both medical reasons, as he suffers from chronic back pain, and for recreational purposes. Miguel acknowledges that his use has escalated over the past year, leading to occasional impairment at work and decreased engagement with his family. He is considered to be in the "contemplation" stage of change.
Client: Look, I know my use has been a bit out of hand lately, and my wife's been on my case about it. She says I'm avoiding our problems, but I'm not sure she's wrong. It's just that after a long day at school, the only thing that really takes the edge off is my vape pen. I've got this back pain that's killer, and the only medicine the doctors seem to take seriously is marijuana. But I can see how it might be a crutch. I guess I'm just trying to figure out how to deal with the pain without letting it take over my life. I don't want to lose my family over this, but sometimes, it feels like the only thing that helps.
Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden with your back pain and the pressure you're feeling at home and work. It's understandable how you might turn to your vape pen as a way to find some relief and relaxation after a long day. You've also mentioned the importance of maintaining your family relationship, which is a core value for you. It seems there's a tension between managing your pain and staying connected with your loved ones, especially your wife who's expressed concern about your use. Can you tell me more about what your goals are for balancing these aspects of your life? And how have you managed your pain in the past without relying heavily on marijuana?

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, Samantha, is a 42-year-old school administrator who has been using marijuana primarily in the form of edibles and vaping devices on weekends to unwind after a stressful workweek. She has come to the clinic due to concerns raised by her partner about her increasing use and its impact on their shared responsibilities at home. Samantha recognizes that her use has escalated over the past year but is struggling to see it as a problem that requires significant change.

**Client:** I guess I do see my friends every weekend, and yeah, we'll have some edibles or vape, you know? It's not like I'm doing it every day. I mean, I love my job, but it's just so demanding. The weekends are the only time I really get a break, and it's my way of relaxing. My partner says I'm using too much, but they don't understand how draining it can be. I don't want to lose them, and I know I should probably cut back, but then, I also feel like I deserve this time to myself. It's not like I'm out doing anything crazy.

How do you feel when you hear their concerns, and what thoughts or feelings come up for you about finding that balance between unwinding and ensuring your use doesn't interfere with your shared responsibilities?

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, Mia, is a 29-year-old elementary school teacher who has been using cannabis primarily in the form of edibles on a daily basis for stress management due to her demanding job. She has been experiencing health concerns related to her use, which have prompted her to seek help. Mia is currently in the 'contemplation' stage of change and is somewhat ambivalent about her use, as she recognizes it's becoming a problem but also finds it helpful for managing stress.

It's clear that you care deeply about your role as an educator and providing for your students, and it seems like there's a part of you that's looking for ways to manage this stress without relying on cannabis. You've also mentioned how important your health is to you, and how the recent health reports have prompted you to consider making some changes.

Therapist: It sounds like you're aware of the concerns your boss has about your edibles on the job site, and it's clear how important it is for you to manage your pain after a long day at work. You also mentioned the positive role you want to play as a father, and how using edibles helps you relax and be present with your kid. It's really important to find ways to balance these aspects of your life. I hear you saying that there might be times when you feel like you're relying on edibles a bit too much, especially after noticing an instance where it affected your commitment to taking your daughter to practice. Can you tell me more about what goals are most important for you right now, and how your use aligns or maybe gets in the way of those goals?

Context: This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, Miguel, is a 42-year-old construction worker who has been using cannabis daily, primarily in the form of concentrates and edibles. He has come to the clinic after his girlfriend expressed concern about his recent increase in use and his performance at work has started to decline. Miguel acknowledges that he's been using cannabis to cope with stress from both his job and personal life but is hesitant to consider any changes to his use patterns. This session marks the beginning of his engagement with the clinic, placing him in the pre-contemplation stage of change.

Client: "Look, I know my girl's worried, and my boss has been riding me about being late and off sometimes. But you gotta understand, weed is the only thing that actually helps me unwind after a long day. I've tried cutting back before, and it was hell. I just can't deal with all that stress and anxiety without something to take the edge off. I guess I am using it more than I should, but it's not like I'm out doing anything illegal or dangerous.

Therapist: 👂 I hear you saying that weed has become a key part of your routine for unwinding after work, and it sounds like it's been a challenge to find another way to manage stress without it. It's understandable that you've tried to cut back before and found it difficult; changes can be tough, especially when they involve something we rely on for coping. You mentioned that your girlfriend and boss have noticed a change in your performance and punctuality, which tells me that this pattern of use might be affecting more areas of your life than just relaxation. It's also clear that you care deeply about being there for your girl and performing well at work, as these concerns were brought up by both her and your boss. Can you tell me more about what matters most to you in these relationships and how cannabis use fits into those priorities?

Context: The session is a motivational interviewing (MI) follow-up at a community health clinic. The client, Marcus, is a 42-year-old construction worker who has been experiencing intermittent back pain due to his physically demanding job. He has been using cannabis primarily in the evenings to manage his pain, which has gradually increased from weekend use to almost daily over the past year. Marcus has a stable relationship and lives with his partner of 10 years. They have no children, and Marcus's use has not yet affected his work or personal life significantly, but he admits he's starting to feel like he's "living for the weekends" when he can use more liberally. He acknowledges that his use might be a problem but is not fully convinced that it warrants a change at this point, placing him in the Contemplation stage of change.

Client: Look, I know I've been using more than I probably should, and my partner's been giving me the eyeball about it. But man, after a day on the construction site, it's the only thing that really takes the edge off. I'm not out here selling drugs or anything, you know? It's for pain management. And I don't get high during the week; I just take the edge off. It's not like I'm sitting around stoned all day.

You also mentioned that you've been able to handle your pain without cannabis at certain times, which shows you have some experience in managing without it.

You mentioned feeling trapped in this cycle, which also ties into your concern about your boss's perception of your reliability at work. It seems like you're genuinely conflicted, as you care deeply about maintaining a good relationship with your employer while also grappling with the challenges of managing anxiety and getting restful sleep. Your values around being a responsible employee and a loving parent might be feeling strained by this pattern of use. You've already noticed some periods where you've been able to manage without cannabis, which is a strong point to build on. It must be difficult to navigate these conflicting needs and desires.

**Context:** This is a motivational interviewing (MI) session at a community health clinic. The client, Marcus, is a 42-year-old software developer who has been experiencing increased stress at work due to tight deadlines and intense competition in the tech industry. He has been using cannabis daily, primarily in the form of edibles, to help him unwind after long hours in front of his computer. Marcus has a stable relationship and no known health issues other than occasional anxiety. He recognizes that his use has increased over the past year but is unsure if it's a problem or just a way to relax. This session marks his first official meeting with a counselor, placing him in the contemplation stage of change.

I mean, I know I've been eating those gummy bears a bit more than I used to, but they help me chill out after coding all day. It's not like I'm doing anything else or even getting high most of the time—I just like the calm it brings. But she's got this idea that it's turning into a 'problem.' I don't know, man. Maybe I am relying on it a bit too much. It's just that the pressure at work is crazy, and sometimes it feels like the only thing keeping me
